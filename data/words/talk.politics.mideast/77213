we keep control of no more the strip price in resource before moshe leave the defence ministry i him we should from the strip come his sink into the strip ever deeper deeper he tell me he propose this to but he reject it reject it too enormous support for the block settler be cite proof the be be implement the block settlement found by the first government of intend to divide the strip into two of show how for this enterprise be the block be now produce per cent of destine for export proportion of cut flower he with the subsidy the settler receive by the present government owe to them house unit the present government doe not effort to recruit new settler to the block prospective settler will get per cent for his house on top of of shekel such show whether the of the strip or forbid to work in the economic be by rubinstein in in from the economic viewpoint could be off the strip worker could be from enter even though be to come by it be during the two the numb of worker to work in from in the to but the be not only due to restriction impose on enter from it be due to the of for in with unemployment in the construction of block the worker from no longer need dependence the entire economy of the strip be dependent on in recent in the strip there be in work for mostly textile of workshop employ of four worker get their or unfinished product together with work instruction from rubinstein this development to the the in the strip be merely per cent of in the west which in turn the in besides the employer doe not security for his employee if the in the strip be just fifth

there be no doubt profit from exploit one of the for the stubborn opposition of other minister to from the strip economic condition in the strip differ little from conquest in in this respect one should not be delude by the gesture intend to economic development in the territory point out permit for open new business depend on prior by the shin bet behind the profess goodwill there be no desire to solve problem just the of good will to do something for the benefit of the but on condition they nicely do not become rebellious never do the interest of the metropolis it economic interest include write in in the development of work in the strip perfectly with show how the economic control work in of the economy lobby be set in motion for purpose of free production from the of competition the method be simplicity itself soon producer succeed in the government or even the industry minister order be issue prohibit the export of give produce to if this doe not suffice be deny licence to or it production the most of such lobby be the one it succeed in limit export of except for those grow by settler not only to but to europe where they otherwise might compete with export be to this regime in the territory the be by the u which otherwise could not support the government so firmly in my view one of the the u feel support likud be it efficiency in pursue the settlement drive this point bring home by ofer in who deplore the settler which he to likud inefficiency he show the settlement growth occur during the term of office of the unity government in which serve throughout the defence minister likud for settle the territory better be to the tiny settlement without found under for symbolic to sum up policy support by the u differ from of likud in the efficiency with which it be implement to policy the territory to be divide into two the be to be rule by directly the minor indirectly in my view this scheme be doom to but horrify price in suffer the
