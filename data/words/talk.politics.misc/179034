her she night m myers she question it she the question the president no intention of for the he behind her percent you know he inform the decision he full responsibility for percent behind reno q the question now we be tell he brief on this but we never get firm of how much he know of the the for the the of the time he fully inform on of of this the level of violence inside the compound them to go now the feel nothing else go to succeed et m myers he with the the decision she to him the lead to her decision he no objection he support her decision to go with it he fully brief q of course hindsight be but look now doe the president doe the white house feel the decision he sign off on prove to be the right to go when you look m myers i think everybody feel when life be lose but i do think be to second-guess the decision he behind the decision he inform it he fully brief it he percent behind the the justice the fbi it difficult there it go on for more seven week four lose their life in the line of duty let not forget this very difficult the decision involve be very difficult but the on the grind the fbi the justice recommend move with this they think give the it the best possible course of there just no point in second guess those decision now i think there q why not they to m myers no not to second-guess the decision i think it to look it to i think the president will some but this from this point to second-guess those decision it not useful q you sound like he go to order of whether m myers i think he more to yes q he will order m myers he more yes he more to q kind of m myers he more to it q but in the morning surely there be some now to whether it the right decision you we do the best we could when it turn out to be m myers i think we obviously we review the the to very outcome i do think dispute the outcome but the president behind the decision be we look the contribute to q the fbi director role in this m myers well he obviously involve in set up the he sign off on it do the be on the grind be work with him i do believe he speak to the president but i double-check q but he very closely involve in every of so forth m myers i would refer you to the fbi on he involve with q will reno be come over to the white house m myers there no meet i do believe she be here q she wo be this event m myers no no to be q do you think there go to be jump on on the of opposition to something out of this in term of to the president detriment m myers well i would hope people would try to use this for obviously i think it useful to look the to the i think the president will move with but i think people this difficult series of decision it very difficult it by who cult who involve in the of four i think it most lot of innocent child lose their life in this i do think dispute the of the outcome q dee dee the white house role in the i guess public in the who who here the white house with people justice to set up reno news conference to do sort of thing m myers i think the her end of the herself the decision to go with the news conference once there point which there enough i think to with some during the obviously people here number of level be keep in touch with people the justice the fbi to try to keep inform there q but reno she do to the president there seem to be she to the white house so who m myers there be people on level q i but who the justice for reno who to the white house m myers there be number of people you know webb hubbell be the to the white house i know he to number of people here there be number of people number of different level involve i do to get into who with whom but there be number of obviously the justice work to keep the white house inform the press inform to the best of it event unfold throughout the q do webb hubbell to the president m myers i do believe so i do know if he he one point q the white house role just to seek or it to direct the public follow m myers it both to keep of the so the president could be on top of it but i think the justice it press on it we be obviously very interest in there throughout the the president follow it very closely throughout the q dee dee on though if the president follow it so closely he the night before with reno why would he to her since then m myers i do know if he to her this morning he keep fully of be go on throughout the he percent behind her decision he be fully supportive of her he morning before event in write q but would he to convey those think to her m myers one more time i do know if they speak this morning q no q there perception she leave hang out to dry m myers just not true i think we throughout the the president full responsibility he i do know how much we be the president behind the on this he full responsibility for the event he belief reno the justice the fbi best they could give the the be evident the time i do know else he to show he support her percent q one of the best of be to pick up the phone tell her m myers i do know whether they speak this morning q why we find out m myers well we i do it here right now q you get six people here they get to do be pick up the phone m myers helen we get to you q dee dee when the president speak with the on be it to either she volunteer or he inquire whether there possible downside to pressure on the m myers i think they discuss the i not go to get into the specific of she tell him but i think he of the risk involve q dee dee the president morning it entirely her decision she then she tell him he doe the president it he the or she the m myers i think they both she decision on the she inform him he no objection i do know how much we be q he the issue be over the responsibility m myers he q doe m myers the president responsibility q dee dee the president he go to would be conduct by someone outside the m myers no q it would be be it to preclude m myers no it simply to follow up on the incident occur q you would i therefore fully with would be hold m myers to the best of our q dee dee there two report out this morning one the justice or fbi or whomever bug inside the complex the other be the child be inject with some kind of poison either leave them unconscious or even kill them before the fire do you know those two m myers nothing more i see in news this morning we get more on it but this point i know i not sure know more report by people who out of the compound q the president receive report in term of go on they be to find out on in the compound now m myers he be brief i do think they get into the compound yet they be still for it to cool off i do think there much beyond be report in the news but he be keep on it q dee dee the president behind reno but doe he feel she get from the expert m myers he belief she he behind the decision she it the decision of her of the fbi of the on the grind he support q the of the decision on the grind doe he those m myers he not go to second-guess decision q dee dee you
