soon we some conclusion on we let you know but the moment he continue to consult with member of congress include obviously dole q be he to else m myers i do believe he to other q be he to m myers i do think be schedule but i would rule it out q we be lead to believe the president mr dole on the subject of bob dole bring the to stimulus be correct m myers i think the president people on i think it expect the stimulus or the job will be of he would with dole the objective of the the first order of business but it both q in the president mind they link in if the continue to reject the stimulus he think it will be to sell to the people he m myers i he might the president be obviously commit to both he like to see job to the people first but you know we outline the of night in tokyo q but doe the president believe the stimulus will it more difficult to to vote for to vote for m myers i think the president be go to continue to work to the stimulus to job we still hopeful we get some kind of job through the congress q be it to the president be now with dole m myers he discuss option with him q on the stimulus be it your over the some themselves leave the support they for the the stimulus

try to get to try to bring the to vote we believe of the member of the unite support the q if you be worry kohl feingold why do george mention project the other m myers i think george point out number of project in number of to be fund or to lose fund if this job doe q no m myers i let you your own conclusion q doe he to to dole or other m myers there nothing schedule but i would rule it out q doe he to put out more press to other m myers we do be we in the process of down the benefit of the job by i think it entirely we sort of to sum those up we send out press to the suggest how their would benefit from this q will you those with u m myers sure we do q do you copy of the one you send m myers yes we those we continue to provide them q dee dee since question subsequent story the further of this issue be give m myers nothing since i think the president comment on it this morning to only it something he know be consider by the force he not decision on i do think we to to q but he business group tell him they support it you tell u m myers i think there be i not go to on who support it i think the president there be some support business group i do think he he directly by them q we to to the sound out business group on this m myers i think there be plenty of public discourse on this over the even recently but i do think i to to q in though the president this something to be consider or down the between then now to this to it mind m myers i think we it be something the work group look they consider wide of option on everything from fund to specific option will be cover by the president the president not it up yet not decision on it beyond i do to q you the question it be consider by in the white house the president comment in george in brief q then suddenly q m myers the work group we throughout we instruct to consider wide of option one of the thing be they consider be some kind of q but the president himself take this off the dee dee suddenly it this go to the credibility of this in in the m myers the president not look this it be present to him yet the work group look it they look wide of option no decision be q it the question of how independently the force be work m myers the force instruct to consider option they seriously they consider option q but not the impression the president leave in the impression he leave this something to be look down the the of his this something not on the not option q if it i tell you q bring him on q you refer to the president tell u those be still in m myers it we tell you q but rivlin comment comment be i seem like effort you two independent officer m myers i would no rivlin not member first of second of it not but they both in the couple of it something be look we confirm i do to to q be it he very few option q be this something it will be incumbent upon the force to convince the president in other word the president himself rule it out it now up to the force to convince him to put it on the or be it in on the be there by discussion with the president m myers it be not the work group mission this point to convince the president of it be their mission to put before him his option to the benefit the cost the pro con of of those option i think they will present the to him in context this point he not not be but it something he will he not decision on q they will present it to him one of his option though he rule it out m myers correct q dee dee be this more be this serious the work group give to this form of m myers it simply of the work group consider wide of option on number of issue to reform one of the option they look be the q dee dee when the work group be this possibility this on the during the time period you be tell u it not m myers i do know the specific time of their of option be i do know q who tell you it not under m myers i refer to the president comment q they discover the sin wo enough money to fund the core benefit m myers no there no decision be on how to for the q i whether the projection m myers there number of option depend on how the be structure you decide how much the be go to cost until you decide the be go to look like so you discus option be rule in our out until you know q dee dee we be tell they computer model on number of possible m myers correct q the question be whether they now determine whether sin would not produce enough money for even the minimum be not very difficult m myers it be question you know we not go to until there number of option be consider it depend on how the be structure the of the the use to for them the decision yet to be q when the president be meet with his which we tell he be do m myers correct q they never once to him these your fund option include the he never the word in his m myers i not go to comment on the specific of the they not but the brief q well you m myers i not other to he not consider the i think be true q no but you it not be present to him option m myers correct q doe he it m myers i not go to get into the of discuss i think for itself q specific dee dee when you he look it do you he look it in term of for or look it in in chilicothe he very specific in define how it work the the whole thing it sound like m myers but i think in chilicothe if you go to his there it discussion of the structure i think the comment be in reference to the economic but it something he think in the context i in chilicothe i be in the process of the work group it something he consider yet it something the work group will present to him the number of option no decision be i not go to comment further on the of the meet where issue be discuss q it your from this podium no discussion of this you no option the option not be present to him m myers be correct q do you by doe the white house still by george in this will not be in the m myers no decision be we nothing to to be q let me follow up here do you by rivlin if kind of be to be use or consider other to the code would to be so it would be le regressive m myers i not go to comment further on might if q but do you by the previous in if there be to be i think the president you exclude food energy m myers i not go to comment on the specific structure of decision be q the president prior to comment this under by the work group m myers i do know q could you check for u credibility question m myers sure q since the force bring together this issue be discuss the begin throughout one to lot of money be you keep in the the press office keep in the over the month when you be deny would be consider it on the over
