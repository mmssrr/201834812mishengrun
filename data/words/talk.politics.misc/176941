the fund will be use to support the of exist public enterprise then there some other fund in the corp other thing which people in will some influence over the distribution of with to your second question let me i would think there would be people in both country who would not feel too simply the government give money to the government there opposition to in in our country throughout our whole history there be opposition to foreign of kind be this nothing to do with if you look the whole history of kind of be i try to tell the people be be this be not this be investment this be investment in our future we spend trillion trillion on on soldier other investment of the cold now with government in with the newly independent the of them work on struggle to get their economy go it seem to me very much in our interest to it possible to do we for to survive for the economy of to grow of the for investment there for u to continue the effort to reduce other element of hostility on both side on our side on the side so i do see this this be investment for the unite this be very much in the interest of the unite the thing i the second of the which i hope to put together next week in my view thing good for my country for the worker of my country be very need some now some common with other people who her but it would be for to view this some sort of just or issue not it be it investment for it wonderful investment like investment there be some risk but there le risk with of return the trillion we spend look other the of the cold q mr president first of you very much indeed for come here to u in the memory of the live correspondent this be the first time president be do this to the press corp so it kind of very i two question one in your introductory of the other press conference you mention in brief you discuss the ii i issue could you tell u do you with president yeltsin to might be do in order to join the of i the npt regime my second question be how confident you the unite congress would be to support you in lift other restriction inherit from the cold president clinton first we discuss the issue of with to i npt with to the need to proceed to the other independent be but to the unite develop strong with them we know one thing we could do would i think the willingness of the to support this direction be to successfully conclude our own on highly enrich would provide not only economic opportunity for but for it would show some out on our but we the people who sign off on the lisbon protocol get to honor they do we to continue to press i myself spend good of time try to the president the foreign minister i strong tie with the unite very much good with but in order to do we need to do together to strengthen the economy of to the unite be fully supportive the commitment to i to join the npt regime be the second question the president with to cocom i would two point first i with the in the congress we will soon i return list of the other restriction some of them in impose on between the unite of the cold we will see whether they how of them we could to do with right now the of the congress with to i think there will be openness to the if the congress be convince there in no more refusniks no more people who wish to who not be to if the be there be no one there who would be who the design to then i think the desire to keep the will be much le with to cocom my guess be it nothing more guess the of congress indeed my own might prefer to see some sort of movement out of the cocom regime but i think they would be will to begin it in the future q mr clinton when i your speech in i get the impression you completely different i stress not to the of mr bush could you in few word be the difference between you your the difference
