this he q the be they do mr well the stop there no question q you go to do it q george do you know these note by boris yeltsin during one of the meet in which it the president tell boris yeltsin not to trust the when they yes they no mr i think complete of the meet the context of the president clinton president yeltsin the time his with prime minister over the kuril the prime minister belief would constructive role in the process i this comment courtesy etiquette but it in the context of where he president yeltsin he believe the be serious their commitment to the process q you the president when the yes they no mr not i do know the word there much longer discussion he do something the line he belief on this issue prime minister intend to go with the process q there be to this to the the press pick this up there to be mr i see the report in the press it doe put the in context it doe the the point of view i do think it go to be problem i believe there be some context just to thing up but i not positive q george the specific comment specific to the kuril or it on etiquette mr the discussion q the specific comment be i to be from the note when the yes they no mr well it i i do think the whole sentence i think the specific comment follow up by specific finish to the sentence where he in this he belief prime minister to keep the commitment q he it first mr i think it just q then you be to it up the president send mr no i do think the president speak i believe christopher some but i not sure how q well this obviously be bigger you it out to be if christopher to some mr no no it just we get the report in the to sure it understand sure there no mr report in the to sure it understand sure there be no i do believe there be on q be our position the they to one thing but mr no the position on the be the president to president yeltsin throughout the two he he good with prime minister prior to the summit he the position the support for the position on the kuril but prime minister commitment to move on the process to constructive role i think president yeltsin very to q listen to christopher on for the few i little confuse be the policy do you to see hussein overturn mr it the policy christopher of the we expect full complete with resolution right now we do not q throw it out further if comply in office mr right i think our judgment be it be not possible for hussein to comply with the resolution in power but the point be we expect by with resolution we will continue to it q you concern the will become the power in the mr christopher speak to over the he we expect full with norm stop support of terrorism q very glib he wo in power if he comply with resolution on logic do you mr right now hussein be not comply with the resolution he be not respect the right of his people be require by the resolution he be not fully comply with the resolution inspection he be not fully comply with the resolution q well when do you think if he do comply he would be out of power mr well right now his power rest on the repression of his people if he stop do it would it more difficult for him to in power q george on the stimulus why be it you the president the of pure politics gridlock why be it evidence do you they just do genuine difference with you in good mr well the time in the the of the one who now the fight for the filibuster support the very fund
