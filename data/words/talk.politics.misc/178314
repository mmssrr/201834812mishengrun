force to go out wide net possible for different on how to reform the system they very wide net they look hundred of different of different but the president not decision q well be the president of their of this option mr i do know if he be brief on conclusion or like from the force on this specific of kind i do know get to his level he to go through with the force very wide of decision i do

be still under from we be tell by dee dee i think three week or so she be not option the big with somebody over this so i remember it it not once but twice be not the mr i do know if this be present to the president something be be look some level in the force q it rule it out though i unlike other option you keep in the mix this one rule out mr this be something be be look but no decision be of kind i it doe it not until you get to the the work group look hundred of different option q if it rule out before it not rule out now then something george yes no q when guy in mr well the work group look the widest possible of option q so something they be look it before they look it now mr well i do know if the work group get to point yet they very wide net q how it possible you dee dee be to sell definitively rule it out option previously now in it be be consider mr the work group look wide of option they not q do you deny you dee dee rule it rule it out on in the month mr i do deny i those the president word those very q subsequent to the president word do you deny within the month you dee dee both publicly rule it out mr i do know the time i think we do refer to the president

present to the president q they consider something the president q rule out q rule out i will the president consider mr the work group not present this to the president they look wide of option i suppose if be he will listen to it doe not he decide to do it q we put this in his in ohio he look the in term of restructure the whole system under those the he it might be consider some future point be no longer the or be the only he see emerge mr i guess i not sure you q he the in the context of restructure system not specific to for q or else q or else q it in the context of substitute for other time of of the whole system mr right q too q be still his view mr i speak those specific comment i think i just go to it the work group they the possibility of yes they q we look she mr they the possibility of it be present to the president he decision no he not q kind of do you when you get the president force obviously not oblivious to his rule something out except in the context of some huge down the line reform go on it own consider which he rule out in context other much then go they look be the president concern sort of thing mr i think the president concern be to sure he get the best possible he concern with sure they the most thorough process for the possible the different if decision be to go with something like it something the president will justify but no decision be those line q doe it though when the president rule something out doe it it get on the if more be mr just true if you but the time he not rule it in he not q him open to it now when he open to it before mr he will to listen to the q he will to listen to the for short-term this he will to listen to it in chilicothe he now open to it mr the context of his comment it not something he to be this be not something he propose not something he q not something he consider those his word it not something now under if we consider it i tell you you now you not it be under mr i the force study this i the president not decision on it q but the door be open for the president to reconsider include this of mr obviously the work group look it but the president not decision q do you know if they will on of the to him mr i do know i if i do know they it in propose i do know they go to the conclusion this be something they should present to him i know this be something the work group look q do you george none of u these question in context of decision the president only the president be consider mr i i the work group the issue of q the president will consider it mr i he will consider the if it be present to him q doe the president work group think when the president no he mr i think the work group try to do the most thorough job possible q george i you question mr sure q no he u to on this q let do in the q no he get out of q i think we get the bottom line on reggie your in if the serb do not the be work out quote we will do our to pursue the lift of the together with our seem to go bite further you just mr sound i just q well do you in other word you reggie mr well the president this be something under it be something he will consider if the current do bring the serb to the q be there some kind of here mr yes there be there go to be vote on the resolution in q on on tighten the mr right we believe will up the pressure we hope will bring the serb to the you know mr meet with mr churkin of they work on to bring the serb to the we will continue to pressure them in different this be one possible option well q the question be whether there for or vote on decision on lift the not the mr the next vote in the be on i know there no vote schedule on lift the but it be something we discuss both with our q why do reggie tell the serb the would do the point of his tell them mr well i this be something under this be something we quite seriously if they do not come to the they should know the consequence of to come to the q they be give q christopher be the thing it seem to the serb in the why should the serb heed of to lift the when so everything be do no effect on the fight in mr i just do the premise of your question it effect the be effect q effect mr if the choose not to heed our then they will the consequence q effect it in mr well the effect it on the it tighten up they not get their shipment through we brief more fully q in george in effect it mr well it to if it stop the to be why we continue to press for the to stop but we believe over time we will continue to the serb will effect i not it go to overnight it overnight but we believe over time the the serb if it to work if the serb to come to the we move with the q be there work george of the the the the schedule vote the unite with of the other if the serb will to sign on to the by then we seek we we will seek mr we we go to q but on mr i do specific but we go to move with the resolution the resolution by time if to effect if to bring the serb to the we will consider other q be this mr we step-by-step we up the pressure we go to continue to do q be there possibility george by the time these step the serb will their then the purpose mr i think the purpose be to get the serb to stop the we pursue on different front we pursue it through the we pursue it through direct we pursue it through tighten the we will consider lift the we turn the screw up on the serb we will continue to do q but if the effort be unsuccessful in get the serb to stop the how effective will be to the serb give they i once they entrench mr i on we go to continue to press for them to come to the now we go to continue to find to stop the but i see into the future q george on the stimulus house they go to hold series of town meet on to try the of your they cite poll which show the more people it the le they
