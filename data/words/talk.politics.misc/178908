four be kill in the line of duty try to enforce the the compound which stockpile innocent child risk the to meet it objective ensue the of then every effort to bring this perilous to end without bloodshed further loss of life the effort be the with whom they be koresh he in numerous which both common of decency he moreover responsible for the injury which occur during the the compound in give his violence in effort to protect his young no be for more seven week by the compound this weekend i brief by reno on by the fbi design to pressure on koresh those in the compound to surrender the include decision to withhold the use of even in the of fire to use would not to but would it hop force the people in the compound to come outside to surrender i inform of the to end the siege i discuss it with reno i the question i think it for me to i then tell her to do she think right i full responsibility for the of the decision end in horrible mr koresh response to the for his surrender by to destroy himself murder the child who be his well the other people who be there who do not survive he kill those he control he responsibility for the ensue now we must review the with eye the future i direct the unite of justice to vigorous thorough to uncover why whether could be do differently i tell the to involve independent enforcement in the i expect to receive in time be require to complete the review i direct the to fully with inquiry so we continue to be fully to the people i to express my to the to the justice to the on the front line who do the best job they could under deeply difficult i to i do i very sorry for the loss of life which occur the begin the end of this in i hope very much others who will be tempt to join cult to become involve with people like koresh will be deter by the horrible scene they see over the seven week i hope very much the difficult which confront there which they will be doubtless require to confront in other context in the future will be better better understand of be now q mr president you first of tell u why you decide q mr president you describe for u it be reno outline to you in your phone with the president i you both if one will go first then the other q sorry you describe reno q mr president the president i both your question but i do it once q you describe she tell you on the of the how much you know it the president yes i tell by the the fbi strongly felt the time come to step in try to dislodge the people in the compound she describe the would be they to go in use which be test not to to or to child but which would it very difficult for people to inside the build it hop the would permit them to come outside i further tell under no would our people fire shoot them even if fire upon they be go to shoot the from vehicle which would protect them there would be no of fire in you know lot of shoot be fire by the cult member the there be no shoot come from the government side i number of question the first question i be why now we seven week why now the i give be the follow number one there limit to how long the could with their limit resource the intensity of by expert there they might be need in other of the country number two the people who review this never see quite like this one before they be convince no progress be recently no progress go to be through the of get koresh the other cult member to come out number three the of their do something to themselves or to others likely to not with the of time number four they to believe the child who be still inside the compound be be well be force to live in condition so for those they to move time the second question i the be whether they give to of the thing could go wrong them might good she the fbi personnel on the scene those work with them be convince the of thing would only with the of time the third question i the be consult soon the to light in the first thing i to be do it obvious this not enforcement people be then bring in help to the some of the problem be present by it so i if the be consult the they they be in there only one minor difference of opinion between the fbi the something both side think not of overwhelm those question get those i if she think it the right thing to do she should proceed i would support it i by q mr president the president go q you the perception report widely television you be try somehow to yourself from this the president no i bewilder by it the only i no public let me the only i no public be i nothing to to be i do not know until in the whether still other those who be see to the or into custody it purely simply question of for event to unfold there i i for why people one or the other but i to the on the before the take i to her i her night she on the king show i to her this morning president it be not possible for president to himself from thing when the government be in control i will this however i surprise would be mild word to would suggest the should resign some religious murder themselves i regret but it be not possible in this life to control the of others in every these people kill four in the line of duty they be they fire on they be never fire on we do everything we could to the loss of life they the decision to themselves i regret it terribly i feel the child but in the end the comment i from reno be when i to her on i now i you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now some more she it of the child they evidence those child still be they in condition they do think it will get with time with the of time i to their word for so be where i think thing q we then you do think this in view of the outcome you do run out of if you it to do over would you decide the president no well i think you be just i this be the fbi do lot of thing right for this country over long period of time this be the fbi find the people bomb the world center in lickety-split record time we inquiry to the step the be there something else we should know be there some other question they should be there some other question i should i for sure no one we could do nothing else to the outcome come different i do know why i the inquiry why i would like to sure we some independent enforcement people not people but outside expert who bring to the best evidence we there be rise in this sort of the world we to confront it i to know whether there be we do when there child involve but i do think it be to the wrong-doers in this be the people who kill others then kill themselves q mr president be there other option present to you for resolve this point from until the president well yes i get report the there be lot of other option pursue if you go you cover it very well the fbi you do very good job of it i the fbi the other there pursue number of other option the lot of them on seem to be work some of the child get out some of the other people leave there one point there seem to be some line of open up between koresh the then he would thing not do them thing just to spin whether there be other in term of the i with the do not involve other option except whether we should more time with the present we be pursue they they to do this they think this the best to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves they think q do the government know the child do not q once the you in with the president up to the congress they do they but i think it very the justice this bring in some outside expert i in my if committee to look into it we will fully there be nothing to hide here this the most well-covered of it kind in the history of the country go q there two question i to you the first be i think they know very well the child do not while the do so the child no this very she it not but it very to the child they could not survive without on let go do those people right to their religion the president they be not just their religion they be the believe they number of them q the president let me go i the question the except to tell you the whole purpose of use the it be test they be convince it would kill either child or but it would force it to run outside one of the thing i i do to get into the of this i do know but one of the thing they be the wind blow so the window might be open some of the might be why it do the desire effect they know there underground compound bus bury underground where the child could be send they be i think they be hop very much if the child be not outside the thing would be do the child would be send where they could be protect in term of the themselves i i do not this question before the suppose to in the compound longer the themselves be to work so it think even if they the would force them out in nonviolent nonshooting m myers question q mr president why you still q could you tell u whether or not you ever reno the possibility of suicide when you the fire explosion go through your mind during those horrendous moment the president i reno be if they consider the worse thing could she of course the whole issue of suicide be in the public he be she the people who be most these kind of issue conclude there no risk of now there would be tomorrow or the next or the or in the future the judgment they whether they be right or wrong of course we will never know when i the fire when i the build burn i sick i felt terrible my concern whether the child get out whether they be or whether they be inside try to burn themselves up the first thing i to know you q mr president why you still it reno decision be it in the end your decision the president well i be i do four or five-hour brief from the fbi i do go over every of it it be decision for which i responsibility i the president of the unite i sign off on the decision give her the to the when i to her on some time she might decision to her mind i if you decide to go with this tomorrow i will support you i do support her she be not responsible to the people i but i think she conduct her duty in she with this i think well she could you edt
