the work force where must go on for lifetime it not just you know but you if i might i like to close just by we do our best to try to the most between the the the sector to build good school-to-work we try to get off to good this summer with would more new summer job include strong component so our young people be work the time dick i think i ought to stop there good we begin i think the discussion riley you so much mr president month we get together work the tonight we focus on five how community such yours student for this world of work this week the the host conference here in summer of work to youth the be to use some fund from president clinton propose economic stimulus to provide job summer school for young people in of the country mr president let minute you to it the summer youth your for more enrichment in the summer job why in your word be so the president i think it for two first of lot of the young people we try to trouble to school while we them to good experience with job we them to continue to during the summer we know from lot of lot of kid trouble in school forget much percent of they the previous over the summertime be very unproductive thing for school to to up lot of time they before secondly we to help these young people progress not only in term of work but in term of we to the divide line between be work be we think the best most productive worker will to be lifetime we think this experience could drive point home these young people to succeed in school or work or in college they go on riley well i think the these kid you mention they go into the next be even reich of course you throughout the i wonder be you comment this component of reich well we mr be for young people whether it for the summer or for the on-the-job work experience combine with be one of the best of young people for lot they difficult time geometry but when they there build something or work on something they see the direct of geometry they it use for lot of young people just sense of connection between the world of work be terribly terribly it during the summer but it for lot of young people even beyond the summer riley you mr president you for youth school-to-work i wonder if you would tell u little bite your concept of how you see it develop the president well first of let why it most new job will be in this will not require college degree but most of them will require some skill go well beyond most people get in high school if you look the the of young people two of good post-high school good go up over the the young people who le tend to lower do not go up in in term fell over the they be productive they be more to their employer so we think big economic interest in try to ensure the young people who get out of high school but do go on to college to work which include two of further either in community college set or on the job i do in this budget you know be to give you reich some fund some incentive to try to work in with with the sector to build these in would be by the business community on the need of the economy in give it could long-term the of the work force the of worker reich i should mr president i think you know this from your experience in of the people this the business community group in of our community of our build school-to-work in there lot of ferment lot of excitement the people this the one who most directly involve in more power to them riley i go to do everything we to build on the success out there riley bob we go to be tonight youth tech prep the co-op those with this subject some of the every one of these school-to-work might reich well one thing we see you i be work this for long time you much longer i we see involvement of the business community be i so delight we do this in the of the of commerce the of commerce of the unite be commit to do these kind of we to work very closely with the the business community be go to be in develop of the kind of job need help the community college institution develop for the job of the future community get to come together i this be one of the most thing you get to of these in community come together work together together you know too often we the over here the business over here group over here everybody be but they not work together in common the third ingredient i would dick would be commitment to excellence commitment both to excellence to skill development excellence this be not we for kid who not go to it this be every young person ought to be eligible for if they to go on beyond to college fine ought to be permissible but we the of job the skill for on-the-job those the component it be do the president i think if i might just interject one point on my experience home the business community role to not simply in here the job skill need here ought to be but in monitor excellence if you the right sort of there the people who the who go to then be hire the worker not go to permit the to survive if they to influence them so i think very when we try to if you will fill in the the level try to set some provide some fund one of the thing we to be sure do be to sure the employer of influence over the of these go to determine whether the whole thing be worthwhile riley we be of course school-to-work the job economic recovery for this summer but let just moment long-term school reform it something close to me mr president i wonder if you would give u some of your for the community out here on i think will be come forth before too long the president well you know when you i be both governor we spend lot of time work on our public school we try to be very with our people in lot of these thing be go to some time to i in write the the governor with of president bush in we go to try to do this with your be to introduce in congress will define the thing the government ought to do to try to help the school the child of this country the too meet those sure when by people show up for school to we get percent on-time high school child the confident in the subject they suppose to know they second to none in science school discipline drug-free of course the fifth i take them out of line to this the be we system of life-long in this country one of those there role role school role school district role sector role you to do in this bill you go to introduce with me in the next few week be to define our job be then to give the rest of of define their job be see whether we meet the of we need to meet it very excite so i know nothing quite like it ever be do in the form of before not tell people they to do with their money but set up for excellence so we do our job i excite it riley well i too i think it will be entirely new role for the government in term of it with serve to support to help out in these reform effort drive by high the point bob let me you one question then we get to the telephone it the subject we of course skill go to be of i wonder if you would comment on reich well you know we percent of our young people who do from college very often they do very they do wonderful system of community college institution but if we skill to which they could which employer would of these young people would find they be much more eligible for job everybody doe to go to college other country you proportion of their go to college but you whole level of people who skill we do it in this country if you do go to college you not loser we to develop those skill we go to be work with the with the with lot of industry in develop those i think they will be the kind of thing our other institution to well our business community riley well why do we go go to the telephone we i see bruce todd of q yes mr president mr reich riley we the opportunity to join you we some volunteer here in who you very let me simply to some of the comment we with much of the tone the clinton very supportive we be successful here in of triple our summer employment over the four we expect to over employ this in the summertime much with the much of the question we design you in your open comment so we must be think but the question involve would be we know summertime be be even more kind of the level might be propose to meet the need of the youth on round more how the community be more involve use the something we believe be very to success in this effort riley mr president the president i think i give everybody to the question bruce but let me first you for you for the work you do in i see some of it i be very impress first with to the summer we hope we structure it in will u to continue the summer will move lot of these young people into school under might them to do some work in the sector too we hope reich be go to try to set up system where we lot of sector job to be with the public sector job this summer we work on secondly in the i present to the congress over the next five we to do be to build in of investment quite for job for school-to-work of which give weight to community input just the question you but do provide some investment which we hope you put with to keep people work be on i will to echo reich moment to try to down the between be see work be see lot of young people quite high iq but so much better when they do when they or just listen so we hope the community involvement of it will be we hope if the whole budget we do budget cut more in the budget some revenue some new money for we be to do just you seem to on your question bob do you to reich well you take most of the word out of my mouth mr president but let me just one thing be one of the most of post-high school for lot of young people who not go on to college in to the school-to-work simply be the of job we get to get this economy move obviously it terribly to get this recovery to get the economy on sort of the prerequisite to everything else if we do get the economy on we i think this be the correct me if i wrong mr president i think be the month we seven percent unemployment or this be jobless recovery lot of those kid go to be get out of school in june even if we do everything right they would very very time get job riley you both of course will be long-term thing will into next it will involve if we hope it will be with every where we be work together to for the in number of different then the with the school district very of will be involvement i think everybody will see energy out there once we get move the next be dr new york doctor q good even mr it be to be on with you this even you know bridge the school work be to since it inception in the include the college the two high school on our the we forge with the school we find this to be extremely effective over the we come to believe there principle very in bridge the school work these include theory in the with in the with provide student exposure to well provide opportunity for them to reflect upon these experience while they strengthen their skill the role of the in the development of high competency my question then be how the the curriculum be more closely with to work experience you suggest to this riley well you very much i think we get response from you on very interest work go on there we go to three people our next guest on the this even will be some in you i on to them we discus it you to comment comment you might the president i just like to if i might one thing i to this i do think i be it i like i think one of the people who will be on the second will be to it more explicitly i i think this whole concept of be very i think we to i consider to be very distinction between be be i think we should keep the go i think we should strong component for people who in the reich it seem to me we need to rethink our entire system lot of these school work for student they for student it not just group of student need them some of the experiment i see the unite dick i sure you see them well experiment they the student they give them combine work school experience then the kid either go on to college if they they go on to community they go on to entirely of possibility direction but we to get from the often go on with young people who simply do or work work within the within our school riley you very much i think go to be the we time for mr president i think you get to move on to i to you reich for be here we your time your it be tremendous help to u edt
