so it completely new q you tell u more involve senior yes conoco like other oil be for to do two thing one to prospect for new oil in west two to try to get into the business of oil well pipeline both oil in the objective here obviously be to of the resource in energy production which will in turn currency revenue which be need so we think this be very very good development for the do well it good for the government role in pull this together through the credit in opic through the q so it to to field there senior right q on point should other expect to get support for such or should they now go to the ex-im try to get the money out of the billion senior well you know ex-im be of the government of the government be push include the the white house for this to be we think it will if we this by there will be billion in for to sell their equipment sell their service q should up of the rest of the their wo be their will or there wo be support for opic sort of such this conoco senior there tremendous of interest on the of oil to invest in we think the ex-im oil the once it be conclude will up lot of interest but i think the interest even extend beyond if so the government will respond q the current budget cost of should it go be there current budget cost senior i to refer you to ex-im for i do know the of q the food be there current cost to or be it until the in which the due senior the food from food for progress which be the fund we do need to go to the congress to expend those fund there will be hit in the budget i refer you to omb for the on q you the corp q the sector how folk go to be involve in senior why do i with the corp first i think the felt come into office there be of in the unite in one or be work the of try to in help on there be or government of in this so the felt the president felt it to try to of these together under one group to give some coherence to the effort to give some impetus to the effort so this be it will be by tom simon who will soon up his duty the for in the former soviet union we very hopeful we might use this corp not only to upon the resource of our own government but the resource of the sector school community the q kind of commitment yet kind of word yet on new money need to be besides the million the president senior the be request fund in of million the president do this weekend be to consult intensively with president yeltsin the unite could in some of these to support reform he be consult with the congress when he return to he be consult with the other government we decision time q two question the billion money first of i think it the sort of consensus do not need more for food so why do you decide to do it secondly could you be stop from further for food of to how doe this fit into senior you know the unite for long time be supplier of food commodity product to i think between we extend little bite of history here billion in credit credit through the commodity credit the vehicle to ensure the of product on december of the government stop it on they now in to u on therefore by the unite not continue so the president work with espy other in the look for other we could promote i think we two to do we million in food through the food for progress but we do not sufficient to spend million in food so we look for i think everybody short-term for would not sense now but long-term would be this be it will provide once the work out for six to period on of then from seven through which be the life of the it will provide for of interest three to four percent so we believe the government belief this be good for them it will the of put them into the out but it will continue this very which be for them it for the community q i from you this could it explicit the to the interest on ecc doe not in this kind of go through be right senior let me be explicit we prevent under the to from continue the commodity credit short-term credit of to the unite of you know those they i think million give you figure so into to preserve long-term to respond to specific request from the government for food know we could it from the we do sufficient there we look food for progress which be we use to effect in other of the world we consult with the government this solution i think the it provide them with the food but give them little bite of relief on the short-term q where do those fund come from senior they come from the food for progress which be under the to spend these fund we do not need to go to the congress for these fund i to point everything in this the billion comprise fund be by the congress the begin to spend these monies tomorrow it very in our eye we expend the fund this we meet these commitment we confident we be to do so q how do you the figure of million doe out or do you from to senior there for it the the government tell u the of they need between now time so the be we would begin the shipment million per month from now until the in the which time wo require the level of food import from the west q i would there go to be some envy on the of some of the other republic of the the scope of this with you give to for the kind of project with the with with some of the other republic senior yes we very conscience of the we interest in extend support to the other country of the former soviet union we tell ourselves we in the of the you see roughly percent of the fund will go to roughly percent to the other country in the of food we be with in food with we will continue i think it to this summit we will go look of our with the other country to ensure they they productive they q the summit to energy other to believe be go to be more user-friendly them in term of senior well one of our objective come into this summit to highlight not only the economic but investment i like to refer to the point i the begin we convince in this problem the problem of how to support long-term we convince no collection of western government the resource over the next to fuel the of reform only the sector do we look our own society we see tremendous in resource in the oil sector it be very good with the need now which be investment in the exist oil well pipeline new technology new to new production the government tell u it to do so why we such on it why investment prominent issue on the first of these in figure prominently night in the meet between president yeltsin president clinton we hop together we might send strong to the business community we support their effort to invest in the unite through ex im opec the of commerce will be there to support them q my question be be yeltsin in position to deliver on more senior we think he be i would note president yeltsin prime minister mr chernomyrdin work for in the oil sector he will now high-level commission with the vice president vice president gore to try to through the currently exist to western investment in the oil sector we believe we commitment to committee committee we look to the work q type of be in to the sector portion of the will the be directly involve in the end of distribution of the fund or be the money simply turn over to the government for distribution their will senior you the of list here it depend on the itself in most though we either work through pbos or government to ensure the money obviously be well spend the money get to the intend source we to the congress to ensure the money be well spend we for the money we do in the couple of month intensively we will continue to do it for of these but they quite different for in the of food for food it be out through for the delivery of the food for we be work through project hope which be for the house for the resettlement of officer we be work with group of pbos on some of the project we work directly with we work with in on project you notice so we here to different under these rubric they go to be out in slightly different some directly with the government some with q the restriction on the cocom restriction you tell u the president to do on senior well george note president yeltsin these in the the president note i think it to we will go now in our own government when we return to look both of these question we get to the government q you be not for these question when you get here senior we be for these question we look them but we not to quick decision this weekend they require let me just on they require with the congress they require with the jewish community we very sensitive to those concern so we to go to them before we q be this design so you will not to go to congress for this point senior i the begin the of this be the fund be by the congress so the will not to go to the congress to seek to fund of these effort in effect they begin tomorrow i know of the responsible for these project will begin tomorrow the of this q if this the president be long-term thing member of congress this moment for moscow why you go to congress suggest to the president of you to go to congress for thing senior i think we be the president be discuss this weekend with president yeltsin some we for fund of project he we leave night by we to consult with other member of congress before do we to consult with our so where it now q we be tell number of these item represent different or new of spend the money could you just tick off which of these item represent or spend money in it not previously set to be senior i think we these project either congress money for through the freedom support there be some fund be leave over from this take office some new how the fund might be expend we do use just the freedom support fund or the fund we go into some of the ex-im opic try to look for to further our of be the food for progress we hit brick with type of fund through we could not go so we look for more to ensure continue ensure continue we think we find it q where for you get the money for this officer resettlement senior from the freedom support fund q in other word of the money be be directly spend in new so to senior most of the project you see if you look the the second it break down into credit if you look under the project million be freedom support fund little bite of it be leftover fund from the fund of course you know the history of those fund q senior from fy i do the figure it not figure q could you tell u here this weekend will the log between over for i ii result of here senior both president president yeltsin president clinton will be discuss this issue this morning in we yet get to security control issue will be this morning session i know president clinton will be very strongly reinforce this be top priority for u we be to the the over the couple of week we might help to the discussion between them up to this point this be very be go on between moscow kiev we the point now of discuss with them if there we could contribute to this discussion help to move thing but in term of be come out of this weekend i do yet know in couple hour we know q just follow-up on the here be of this rob peter to boris since it current you it from be put it into this fund senior there smoke mirror here i think it point to note we could give you of number include fund we go to long-term commitment to of these project for the enterprise fund the effort the house effort we to the our long-term commitment we could put in big number this could be bigger but we to point this be fy it fund we we go to do we we go to do the president feel very strongly in the there be the western government the of government put up budget figure for number of we not to meet them we determine the president be determine to out every single in this we do it but we do longer-term commitment of the discussion on economics this weekend we look for on it be we do to most effectively support reform we tell them we do commitment on some of these beyond this q it from senior no we the question be we of these fund so we it from other country to for in the be no we not do so q in term of fund there be no monies leave you simply find to find money somewhere else doe in support the theory senior not i do think it doe the be the commodity credit credit short-term to within to month you know debt problem to meet those commitment so we look for to do two thing to meet requirement for they net importer on meet our objective of sure the to sell their product to we simply look for to we to do it this be successful in other we not try it before in the former soviet union but we think we should now q be this the bush-clinton for since these fund be first derive by put by president bush senior no i do think lot of these fund be by the congress be in this take office inherit some the bush but we long six to seven week review of this we decide to meet the commitment be by the previous but we go well beyond them in fund the enterprise fund which just but the not be fill out with there no number to it in group together some project try to them into coherent whole in the effort i would be clinton further we listen to the government listen to the who tell u the resettlement of their officer to them for economic president clinton respond to we long-term commitment beyond this project we go to figure out to do much more in try to settle those officer i would the president give impetus to of u in the to think much more it be we do on there we some experience some lend itself to the experience in for the of corp which be new we hopeful we the resource of the sector well the government to objective so i would not it most of you know i civil i in the i very with the do i would this clinton for q there be lot of criticism in the not get to the people be there in this outside of the will this money will not just it be by the government senior i think i know the president other senior of our government concern money be spend wisely it get to the source it intend for which it intend so we go to the will in sure the fund expend properly they their source i would not this be not simply of support solely to the government some of these project in go to be work out directly with with business the enterprise support be of senior if i could just word on this point with to the one we be look very very closely be of use firm in for these kind of they would be work very closely of course with the firm who would be the prime but this be fine i think of more of flexible get some of fund down to the level down to the grind in but the time ensure it be spend efficiently for the purpose for which it intend q when would the corp when do you see this how would get it off the grind senior well the president be for the of corp i think it to we go to work out it over the next couple of week simon up his duty on but in effect we over the couple of week the begin to out to people in the sector who come to u u to help their in we we will be helpful we try to kind of in much more effective the of our own government we do or in in one or we think it sense to them together to focus their effort q excuse me how much of this billion will be spend in the unite by good senior i do figure for you now but we could try to work something up in the next couple of on q this figure be the figure be in the press do this grow result of the discussion or we just be off the senior no i think the press be little bite off the i sorry to no this president clinton put u to work seven week on this he brief intensively on this he contribute lot of the in this he contribute lot of the in the i think it to we this rough work out two week we be refine it ever since we spend couple of week go over it with the government both the in the government in moscow through our own so it be evolve but this be together for two week q where be yeltsin input into this then there so much before the president to get yeltsin view need so forth be in the out senior no it both president yeltsin on tell u for support for the of business be to him the resettlement of officer be first foremost the effort to the industry be to them so we do to try to those the centerpiece of our o the we listen to him on the effort we be work with the government for month on this try to work out the so the government on most of these involve every step of the but let me get the other of your question the president be use this weekend to set of we might we look for his the president bring his own to the for on energy the environment in house but we look for not we need to consult with the congress we need to consult with the other government q there nothing in the the you in with senior this i work out two week we since then consult with the government on the of it development so this weekend we future more the unite other western country do to support reform in which be our objective here q i notice you money to businessmen officer you tell me job for worker who by senior you right we to young in service in the unite of the house it not just to build house unit it to officer who retire into other profession q money for job for worker whose job of senior we not yet money for q why not q of the million be go to build house unit be lot of money per unit give the western will buy in the former soviet union senior if you to do house the right it not just the build the of house you get to think the utility you get to think the of you get to think electricity so forth it it not enough to put retire officer come out of or or vilnius in house in western we think we to try to those officer well this be respond to request from the government q of the million will go to senior right q you build or single senior we single dwell q you only will be serve by this senior i to i think i point out this be project we do to do give the experience the the turk the in build house in western we do not to into it with huge of money we to do be work over the next couple of month try to figure out with in the sector the best to get this job do i note we long-term commitment to so i would expect we would put lot more money into this in the future but we to do it wisely we to spend the money wisely q be it this convince you it will protect reform will be in position to the money they suppose to consider their other debt problem senior well look i think it to note the unite on it own doe not the to fuel of reform it get to be collective western effort we look to our to do more well but beyond it the do be go to decide the of reform we simply role we feel we to do so which be consistent with our interest q do the president the of the contribution it would security prosperity for the unite so be it this doe this senior i think you to go to the objective of our policy be we to do everything we to support the of reform we convince if reformer in power then we be to continue the of force foreign policy economic which the three benefit to the unite from reform in so it not simple question you just this be the it long-term question we to long-term commitment to it q then on the question of to convince you they be to seven to from now senior well the government commitment to we hop be if reform continue if they continue to improve their oil sector currency revenue will be in position six or seven from now to those q government-to-government we ever get into with the senior i do to on i do go or on this but in the four or five yes it be the previous we export to just ensure this be different type of effort q government in other sector you i know it do in senior i think it to this be new unique effort pdt
