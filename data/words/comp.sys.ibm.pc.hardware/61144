from kenneth robert subject re irq port set in write in klossner write these disk controller device there device require exclusive interrupt ownership eg disk controller there device doe not require exclusive ownership ie it will interrupt with device eg no in bus the one pc use two not interrupt this be due to screwup in the bus design for if your to drive interrupt number then it must hold bus wire to or time depend on whether or not it interrupt this preclude let interrupt number when two or more device in bus pc interrupt it they implement by single interest would you to to me then how my pro my printer irq successfully i you they both set to irq i no problem my computer be dtk ibm clone simple first be correct i see where there might be some confusion it be indeed possible to two configure to use the interrupt they not the interrupt in the sense it be not possible to both the time here be for some time i short of free interrupt i controller not floppy need one of it old drive my solution to use use for where my modem be i do this i i would never be use the modem the when kermit run it it own interrupt for us the port if the drive be to interrupt kermit would not clue to do the controller since the controller would not be service it would most likely likewise when the run it interrupt for wo do for the port under do print be not interrupt-driven the bios poll the of the port to determine when byte be send why you your sound both configure to use try on nt see how you get kenneth r voice oberon inc one drive internet the view opinion express my own do not reflect those of my employer
