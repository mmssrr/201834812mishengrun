from wlsmith smith subject re ide v scsi in greg write why do you with the spec-sheet of the bus first you quote scsi spec till you blue in the but if they exceed the bus then the point who or vlb the only worth invest of new pc worth of money in then do it you scsi so expensive on pc we until or two the bus ie no one buy scsi for be slow you scsi on bus be not winner when to ide you do to vlb-ide us the connection ide if be limit by ide whether it to or vlb not i get different out of my ide when i my bus speed on mine for one thing scsi blow ide out of the down if ide better throughput why be it use on file server ide be just of the old ibm mfm controller how it look from point of view it never to be to be implimented different be there ide or from the ide drive the drive be to provide the scsi version of ide drive to deliver higher to their scsi of higher rpm different of etc give the question scsi use only single drive controller be it then to get scsi drive will do for the scsi choice to sence doe meg scsi drive cost no the nice thing on o scsi use both drive once i get unix on one of my pc with windogs the o only use one of the two ide drive one time it pretty ugly if be go from one drive to if scsi the to perform without the to go through the cpu or memory then yes be the to do it i know ide do but when the cpu from both drive to be store in memory you scsi from both drive the time to memory the time work off irq on or bus i just buy for my home i for it i see ide drive friend of mine just get meg ide drive for million byte or with the he get close to on his doe your figure include few hundred for scsi driver no we scsi be expensive simply nobody do common for the pc if they common implement method of scsi to pc like in sun or then you find scsi the connection medium of choice so you scsi would be the type consider the of pc do cd-rom drive or or etc most pc only or drive run do scsi drive cost lot more mfm or rll drive the time how common be scsi drive under meg to there lot more the of common prevent scsi from become the connection medium of choice i wo the scsi for good well implimented but i still to know why it better ide on bus when it come to o when from single scsi drive on single drive scsi be more expensive but on point be it this be this be do you get more for the money for the people will only single drive in their system of the o will the scsi choice give them more ide but you buy your pc for so you to more drive or true but on the bus which the option be there for cd-rom drive or run off their own you different type of device them concurrently no this be hold up to the first time scsi buyer the best but how scsi device will the first time scsi buyer doe it sense to go scsi for single drive system scsi device work on different i pc home move drive between them be very nice with scsi hook them up they go with the post on the scsi i or ii spec you sure pc scsi drive even if they be the from either ie there no or file difference be it scsi device work together better ide device for recently i older connor meg ide to meg ide the connor must be setup the it will work no other on scsi you set the check the plug it in it go so the c drive on the connor become d drive to do be this problem i problem with ide exclusion i notice the time it to switch from drive c to drive d be quite long to the time it to switch from drive c to d on scsi system under o this be very thing be go on once two ide drive in my system for file i never see difference when switch between drive nor i ever see difference when file between drive or the drive one thing i notice fringe benefit be the to older drive on scsi system with little problem we get bunch of meg drive i to my pc i now get the full but it doe me to meg drive meg drive drive meg drive on the be nice long the power supply keep up i do believe there be the possibility for up to ide drive on pc simply put scsi be ide no mysterious jumper to figure out but mysterious expensive driver to figure out ide doe require driver consume precious do memory
