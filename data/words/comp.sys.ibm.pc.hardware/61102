from russest steve russell subject re cpu in nmp write just get system consider get for the cpu the processor when run be too hot to touch so i think this be good long when i do some electronics i somewhere the region within chip define etc slowly diffuse over time this with hence hot chip go off-spec sooner out there get cpu yes be there more type yes see glue-on clip-on one-inch my be the inch i use just plop down on top of the chip during service do you to remove the cpu from it scoket to the depend on the mount do cpu derive their power from drive power line only if the trouble with cpu only if it go out get effect which doe help chip life doe evidence cpu complete of money longer system life good economic sense to me how these glue clip melt cheese yes well not the melt cheese roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with oppose to without let you touch the the rule of thumb for cool i v info the look slick work well but i bother by the loss of cool if the go out with the power supply you there every few feel the blow i prefer to put stock off the drive or front to blow the cpu depend lot on though on-chip from fry electronics in the sf i get the stock power supply for steve
