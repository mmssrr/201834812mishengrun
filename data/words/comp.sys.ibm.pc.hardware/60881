from jim johnson subject cpu n p just get system consider get for the n p cpu the processor when run be too hot to touch so i think this be n p good long when i do some electronics i n p somewhere the region within chip define etc n p slowly diffuse over time this with hence hot n p chip go off-spec sooner n p out there get cpu i work for pc oem we offer both system line our pro cpu cool on unit n p be there more type there n p do you to remove the cpu from it scoket to the sometimes depend on the specific model n p do cpu derive their power from drive power line the one i see do come with connector so you do to connector n p trouble with cpu none n p doe evidence cpu complete of money touch chip it be run few minute you wo feel the be n p how these glue clip melt cheese depend on the model use clip sure you use sink or or you will your money n p roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with oppose to without i v tough to tell i do know the chip shed lot of slmr murphy optimist be your up dlgqwk
