from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi wlsmith smith write this doe the question be multi-user o no mention of ether either but from point of view why doe scsi when it come to multi be it could be on the drive scsi find it it get it off the drive into the computer doe it better system i think scsi good bus when multiple device if we only single drive why scsi be inherently from drive you the i do you confuse the drive to the throughput from my ibm info sheet by ftp on in the both ibm scsi only device common to both ibm the use of device drive printer nubus plus only some monitor cd-rom develop some for scsi controlers while ibm no controller which result in on ibm problem there lot of device which which problem for more then two devise off the scsi port scsi be suppose to be only the begin the end other set up problem for either or ibm device per scsi controller synchronous require controler chip provide only not wide which both see device per scsi controller in mode be fully complient tend to be implimented very since it need different controller in both which tend to be very expendsive speed with burst with burst with burst in mode be limit to device reduce or only throughput due to the difference between wide port ibm hd limit to drive by design or of development ide device electronics currently the most common be use for medium drive more one drive so it lowest set in mode the through put of ide in mode in full mode it blow poor ide out the window down the street into the the problem become the drive keep up with those through put be where the bottleneck cost of come from not the itself but more more from drive to use the through put the cost of scsi be self fulliling prophisy few people buy scsi it be so expencive for the pc which in turn convices produce scsi which would reduce it cost be so scsi be expencive be the effect of the rule of the more item sell the le item to the brunt the cost of so the le item to cost drive through put to be limit by the drive while ide itself limit the through put
