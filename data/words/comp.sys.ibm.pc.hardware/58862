from drice d keith rice subject re to who respond to my post i get the number for western tech support determine i need to the bios to the super bios it will drive with up to write up to cylinder the be by check or money order send to western support group box irvine the super bios be for wd xt drive controller in the series the bios on my system would only up to drive the response to my request for help follow my sig it long keith d keith rice university of north of computer science denton drice drice response below from receive from by ponder id from bob receive from by id est receive by id est est to drice ponder or to drice subject re newsgroups in-reply-to ponder university ny cc in ponder you write i recently buy use drive the guy tell me it be fully test it good i take it home to in my ok i little behind in technology i mfm controller i the drive power up the system i get post error my controller be western rev c i the drive be the system be question i i mess with this older stuff fun first problem i forsee be the will not be with wd unless it the right bios rom check the number on it it should be the only non-smt chip on the slightly below center leave the bios should either or if the digit you get problem controller jumper set follow represent jumper look right jump with between pin to select the controller the drive jumper follow represent jumper look right delete here my question the drive controller w other i notice you leave out the jumper set those control drive the controller think it if you the rom set it like this open open open open close close open open note those how wd run the number on the jumper block top to bottom represent the jumper pin pin select the first drive set drive pin select the second drive drive if you the rom it i to look up how to do it i do the big book right here the jumper on the set correctly see you might problem if the jumper not right the risk of be insult sure the on right good on the jumper on the try move it to the opposite side of the drive it one or the other the go to i throw it on few time my for be my system bios in need of dunno ibm rom to be quick to check be to boot do run debug enter d fffc the be the debug prompt this will return the rom if it of use keith rice if i oversimplify of the i it just to know of person i to bob from chpp mon receive from by ponder id mon receive by id mon gmt from chpp prof p subject to drice ponder mon gmt elm version mime-version content-type content-length or if you use twist then move the jumper on your drive to the neighbour pin sure the twist be for
