from willmore willmore subject re ide v scsi wlsmith smith write write ide us technique i believe floppy controller us most use be no big nothing to do directly with scsi no the simple style ide controller doe not use the cpu perform the with string move instruction this require the cpu stop it be do the only the drive controller be they ide or scsi these controller tend to cost the wether they ide or scsi to get the benefit ide must it price on the controller for when rewinding or the be issue to the controller the bus be to to other device on the bus this productivity or do something else while up your drive which to be i do while this group you your for if do few more it could floppy etc while you be do something else the will support it but do wo this nothing to do with scsi floppy on the ide bus your no sense this be ide issue the floppy their own processor on their controller which of these the difference between ide scsi be scsi intelligent they their own controller they depend on the cpu to do fewer thing for them ide drive need processor to their it long story but i still use ide on my except for the cdrom which to scsi i move between both if when scsi be better support on the ibm-clone i to completely get rid of ide if you stick with do you wonder why you i why unix or type o do the thing with ide it with single scsi drive the the cpu to request of the device on the scsi bus then go it business when the device be do it issue to the or the function complete most scsi will the into memory without the interupting the cpu therefore it to continue work uninterupted ide support no such concept you see how this would be win in system willmore willmore before dishonor better greek willmore ever notice how much they look like orchid lovely
