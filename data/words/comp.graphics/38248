from yngvesson subject re point within polygon scrowe simon crowe write i look for to determine if give point be bind by polygon doe such code or reference to book on the subject well it be while since this discuss so i the liberty of reprint without permission so sue me eric reprint of the very interest discussion of this topic o o x snip snip x o o give fish he one give fish rod he fish never do with in mind i reprint without permission so sue me post some on this very problem note the use of postscript technology of this list in the post here few eric intersection between line polygon by tom duff from deb newsgroups keywords p np curve ursyhon theorem of computer in ncsmith timothy lyle smith write i need to find to determine if line intersect polygon i would prefer method would do this in little time possible i need this for use in i think this be very difficult problem to with line polygon set which both number of point here few off-the-cuff first we need to check if the line the polygon now the curve theorem the polygon divide the into two open thus region thus the line lie completely inside the polygon the line lie completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will the line intersect the polyon now the of this question if line intersect polygon so this be decision problem one possibility the decision model be to reduce the question to some other well know problem q then try to solve q to q give to the decision problem in recent geometric problem be successfully model in new postscript see postscript by system isbn co so give line l polygon p we write postscript the line l the polygon p then output the by output we the execute which print of the line the polygon quick of the provide to the reduce problem q thus the problem there two problem with this there be infinite number of to encode l p into the reduce problem q so we will be force to invoke the of choice or but the use of the of choice be not in very serious light these more the question to whether or not the postscript q will output piece of or in other word will it now postscript be expressive enough to encode everything turing might do thus the problem for postscript be it be quite possible the problem will turn out to be i wo even begin to go into other difficulty such finite precision run out of ink or both couple of reference might be newton i university press sorry i do isbn for this introduction to theory hopcroft j j the c b ritchie d of two city dickens c from td tom duff overkill t bell hill nj the be not suggest he should know better he hang the for long enough by the well know reduction see j d dobbin j comp obfusc ii pp line-polygon intersection be reduce to circuit without the use of grobner so lpi to coin be only np-complete besides turing-completeness will no longer be problem once our be deliver since it will be to complete infinite loop in millisecond with from deb well sure it no worse np-complete but only if you restrict yourself to the where the line condition on it second i think there from with this j o n s y n g v e s s o n dept of engineer voice university of linkoping sweden
