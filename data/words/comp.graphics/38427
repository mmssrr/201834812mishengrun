from steve hcrlgw steven collins subject sphere from point method be to first find the center of the circle define by set of point intersect the from there this would define the circle center however imprecision would the line not intersect supposedly to intersect in unique point if they not think this why do you project the line onto the form by the line do intersection in the in where you unique solution unless they which wo in this then use the line from the circle centre to determine the point of interest this the messy error require to do the in hope i put my foot in it steve steven collins steve visit computer phone tokyo
