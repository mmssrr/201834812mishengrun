from spworley steve worley subject re sphere from point bolson bolson write boy this will be if it be or give point non how doe one find the sphere be center fit those point i know how to do it for circle from point but do not see to do it in i check some geometry book gem but still loss mercy on me provide the solution it not question i do ref list this either but think it bite it should be too three of the point find the they define well the circle they lie on you you this find the center of this circle the line through this center to the of the three point through the center of the sphere with the unused point two of the point this give you two different line both through the sphere origin their interection be the center of the sphere the be to compute it just the from the center to of the point i the to you but this be method would be to of point the form by the bisector of line segment the center of the sphere three will form three intersect point this might be to implement steve spworley
