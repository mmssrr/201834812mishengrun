from kenneth subject re in srp stephen write how do you go orient in the direction give set of point edge look for edge inconsistency consider two vertex p q which connect by one edge if p q be edge then q p should not if both p q q p edge then the flip when you edge this be you otherwise you pick edge edge the enforce consistency with edge pick edge p q it ok for f this edge if more oops sure edge in f consistent the should be p q q r r s s t t p flip those which wrong of the edge in f ok them to queue check for inconsistency do let the queue both p q q p remove edge from the queue go to if edge be discover to be inconsistent then you lose if step find more one edge then you lose otherwise when do of the edge will be consistent which of the will either point in or out decide which be out be leave exercise kenneth computer science university of
