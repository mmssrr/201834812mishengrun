from gorgen gorgen subject need help line together i for help on sticky problem involve low precision in i encounter in different pex i find discussion of this problem in resource i on the vendor i post this by itself on the with test the problem on the problem be to describe without picture hence this be longish if you run pexlib interest i you to build run the test in to see the effect yourself with my to with it it depend on the utility code from the book instruction for fetch it ftp give the problem to be solve be to or stitch result from the use of with polylines with fill the line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the even when the endpoint of the line coincident with vertex of the of this it tossup whether the will the line pixel or the pixel to be the result tend to be effect even though the line be suppose to be solid use the pexlib my to solution be to use two slightly different pex view in two view entry one for the one for the line the pex structure or mode output must be so one view index be in effect for the other be in effect for line the result be slight shift in npc for the line so to to the tossup in of the line this shift be effect by move the front clip use in the pexlib view entry for line just vrc to their position in the view entry use for this when point be to npc it will be slightly bigger if it come from line if it come from thus the desire i would expect the roundoff error which the problem to to few unit most out of the entire of the from to if not or bite therefore it seem tiny of the of in vrc between the front clip ought to suffice to fix the stitch but in experience show the shift to be much to of the it worst when the npc component of the slope of the be high when it more or le edge-on to the viewer it if only or bite of the this be so one problem be by sometimes the polylines show through which they suppose to lie behind i observe the problem on both pex server to the degree the test the problem on mit pexlib this version be know to compile run on hp-ux system with pex open question why doe this i configure the pex view wrongly be there difference in for line oppose to pixel center versus corner which could be correct for pex implementors precision in their something else to do it i fix my use of the view to better precision in hlhsr be there i to remove the stitch i just out of luck help would be immensely gorgen internet gorgen inc gorgen uucp uunet gorgen
