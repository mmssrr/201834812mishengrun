from oeinck subject re detect double point in curve renner john renner write in ron in oeinck write i look for on detect double point cusp in curve see stone tony derose geometric of cubic curve tog vol no july pp i use reference find i need to go to their tech report stone tony derose cubic curve xerox december first to who reply to my question i implement the from the i very with the result i need it for my curve routine in some offset curve loop occur i now method of detect the of curve with loop i do not follow the strictly the check if the fourth control point lie in the the loop which be bound by two one ellips be too i the surround it by for line the check be now simple my routine never ever output self-intersecting curve
