from pinky the behind the subject view on isomorphic perspective i work upon use isometric perspective to use in populous you look into room look to the follow xxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx xxxx x x xxxx o xxxx x xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx the good thing this perspective be you look move in three dimension still your vision since your viewpoint be the the routine be for in my two rise edge slope of i use mode x i run into two problem i sure other try this before their own opinion the routine for be but when i through them i by the i now consider some routine speed be not be it worth the effort to the the skew thus be of nice or be this too much of burden present problem the i use tend to overly distort the i try to decide on pixel go where come up with method for to crosswise currently i produce line follow the slope line be directly under line line move up line leave pixel line be under line this fill the without unfilled pixel but it distortion come up with better it be to simply the skew there other sticky problem with this perspective i on hide by use store in x y form for those of you who notice the top line of with it bottom line this be why there to be illusion ie it to be either the inside or outside of cube depend on your mood there no point this simplify the code for object which do to they move in the room i decide this be since enough very little in the of object in perspective hopefully the context of the picture ie on the floor torch on the will dispell in for help till next time o o v o v pinky v
