from inge subject vector of spline i work on system which us give set of key position x y to control movement i use spline describe in the proceed to number of inbetweens between the key i the inbetweens to be give in the form x y dx dy where the three the x y component of the view direction vector of the when position x y the method present by only with the position of the inbetween view point to be i try to set the view direction view point to the chord between the two view point which in not key but this sligt discontinuity of the view direction vector the key position the movement seem to work fine i quite i think i not simply error now i wonder if out there use this spline form for purpose how they decide the view vector i reply to be to me else interest in the will be send of the reply if they me n g e r k e s t d comp sc nth institute of technology some people to get i to ford
