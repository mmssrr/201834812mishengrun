from rws w schmidt subject outline of spline i work on problem to be very simple turn out to be quite difficult i wonder if on the net see this problem hopefully some publish solution to it the problem be to outline of define by two roughly cubic spline for input the problem with two set of point where set of point be on the edge of object which we two only between the edge but which exist in three to the object we fit cubic spline through the point spline be effectively compute sequence of line segment the curve spline number of segment we the nth segment spline be roughly but not the spline by segment n spline it to the nth segment of the oppose spline use the of segment to form two which will be fill in to color the depth sort the in sort order project onto color the the edge of the be the edge of the line edge color with edge color it be the edge color in step be the of the problem the be to effectively outline the edge of the the net result however lot of in the edge of the the for this they involve both problem problem result from the project the spline if this problem sound we would know other work in this
