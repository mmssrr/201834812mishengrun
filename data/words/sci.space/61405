from steinly steinn sigurdsson subject re burster where they in write in steinly steinn sigurdsson write the problem with oort cloud source be no be propose it would to involve new physic i tell closest to oort source be model of b-field pinch by comet it get too hole in it to count but it good try so you model for grb i do model for grbs recent just rule out the merge neutron hypothesis which lot of problem we to look for model be independent of model hmm the superbowl burst be in press to doubt on the merge n hypothesis from i i see the only the press i it be consistent with some of the merge n model on the possibility of grb in the oort cloud just through the service to get copy of this here be the of to these event possible source which distribute should under this be why the oort cloud of comet be keep on the list there be no know for grbs from nucleus unlikely it seem the possibility grbs in the cloud not be exclude until it be disprove this doe not propose for grbs in the oort no doe not fit the i big difference ignore the question of how you fit distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution be not well know in comet which not well know not good of the oort cloud distribution steinn sigurdsson lick steinly the of very very strict you just bend them for your own benefit
