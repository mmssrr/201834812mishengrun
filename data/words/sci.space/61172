from josh hopkins subject dc-y i be to three in the month which might be of interest i some of my note below since my note be by no error mine permission be to copy this without restriction note for newbie the clipper project be produce single to orbit vehicle the dc-x vehicle be vehicle design to test some of the concept invovled in ssto it be currently undergo test the dc-y vehicle would be full vehicle of orbit it not yet be fund on rocky nelson of entitle technique for mission here the university of illinois mr nelson job involve use to determine the within give requirement he be not directly involve with the clipper project he spend time with them recently use his for their he thus use the dc-y project for most of his while i do think the of implicit of much interest to the i hope they i fell during i think of you will be interest in some of the from the the first give the of for orbit the restriction be must below g i this be drive by but i do not verify the clipper y version engine booster the booster which lower isp shut down in mid-flight thus one question be when to shut them down mr nelson show the follow plot of v time g go this be good the big difference be the line g by the should be curve which up the be only the up for very long g g sec sec mention before be g level must be keep below eight engine the vehicle burn fuel the it get close to the booster engine throtled however they quickly become inefficient low power so it soon more sense to cut them off this the dip in second the engine bring the g level up to then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff doe not occur in orbit the be for slightly higher the desire the vestige of slow the vehicle slightly thus lower the to desire question from the q would it sense to shut down the booster engine in once very perceptive worth consider they not yet do the shut down four of the problem give q so the for this tell u he good propulsion but tell not to use it my question doe know if this security be due to sdio protect security or md protect their own interest the second reentry from orbit to just before the pitch up the biggest in this one be the they be try to he show of use two different model to show both be very i think we be suppose to this they be very the end result for orbit ksc the dc-y would degree of would it reentry profile degree south i would the but he do know of the flight profile josh hopkins find or one to
