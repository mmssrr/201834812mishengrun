from subject re burster where they in steinly steinn sigurdsson write the problem with oort cloud source be no be propose it would to involve new physic i tell closest to oort source be model of b-field pinch by comet it get too hole in it to count but it good try so you model for grb recent just rule out the merge neutron hypothesis which lot of problem we to look for model be independent of model on the possibility of grb in the oort cloud just through the service to get copy of this send to with the subject line get here be the of the currently for the origin of grbs put them but long there be no to these event possible source which distribute should under this be why the oort cloud of comet be keep on the list there be no know for grbs from nucleus unlikely it seem the possibility grbs in the cloud not be exclude until it be disprove we use the on the distribution of grbs the up to the of orbit by to whether there be for between the distribution of grbs comet the distribution of direction reflect to some extent true in the column density of the oort cloud we the vov test to both distribution we perform of test kolmogorov-smirnov test for the distribution in test for the multiple moment include test for the effect of possible these test imply it be unlikely the two distribution but the be not sufficient for rule out connection with complete confidence we perform which show only when the number of burst exceed sim it be possible to rule out between the distribution currently it be only the of these test with the find for the vov which the oort cloud of comet unlikely to be to grbs
