from ron subject jpl vlbi project meet with from the jpl universe vlbi project meet with by ed mcnevin member of jpl very long interferometry vlbi project recently conclude week-long series of meet with from the meet be of vlbi week hold jpl in be intend to between in the development of the vlbi project recently jpl flight project set for in vlbi will two the vsop vlbi observe with it telescope both will up with telescope the world to telescope network hope will telescope observe power by of vsop will use limit six-hour orbit to conduct science while the will exploit orbit to conduct will point source for roughly hour while telescope will point the source object while within view on to dr joel smith jpl project for the vlbi meet like those hold jpl will permit who little previous experience in interferometry to work with the community will be during the complex require by the vlbi project one of our be develop the methodology for the two rely on the correspond while use the telescope to observe the object smith three new be build dsn other three other in green this network of telescope will use precision clock high-speed recorder to collect the to the in socorro the will combine process then it to mission in moscow tokyo jpl electronic smith be optimistic the telescope by the vlbi network will provide with better resolution ever be before by telescope to closer look object in there be long history of use telescope smith we intend to do be to extend into orbit our be to look deeper into the core of nucleus other source to drive those thing we see so with smith note if one the nucleus you find jet to spew speed light energy level million of time you would expect he some believe hole be in the core of these they fuel the jet smith hope by use vlbi to look further into the core this theory be support or disprove include now be test in the unite be schedule to for test this of this will permit scientist engineer to how to modify the high-speed the in order to the odd will from the more telescope involve in vlbi smith be meet with the like those hold jpl in proceed smoothly yet he know the in could country in the project nothing be ever smooth he but the be incredibly open with u we some likelihood we will not succeed of beyond our control yet there tend to be of keep these thing go scientist on both side try people the of this level smith point out the more just fulfil commitment to science mission the be extremely since be to their science mission he but smith note look the vlbi mission opportunity to the technology involve with vsop their highly v vehicle yet of the risk involve in such project jpl smith be for the vlbi project be beyond the hurdle otherwise might the project we the virtue of two if either out we would still something with the other by themselves both independent excite mission ron jet propulsion telos the from new be
