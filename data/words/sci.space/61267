subject re burster how energetic could they be from in jfc john f write if burster would from the be expect how be the core to how much energy doe burster put out i know energy depend on which be unknown of the form x erg per be ok john jfc i to turn to one of my problem set i do in for this little problem i do but i do the problem set we do not too long so i use hope it you this be highly simplify problem with very simple burst burst more complex this i will use here our burst flux of erg of second during the frst second of the burst the second it flux be of the flux it flux be the flux the rest of the time the flux be erg then we to find the luminosity of the burst for different sphere oort cloud the edge of the or the edge of the we the flux over time to find the fluence then use the old pi for of pc we find l pretty energetic for close by for the model we find for the model you energetic i suggestion could put out much energy in one second jeremy
