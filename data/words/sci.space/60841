from eder eder subject re to the top floor from product sheet their resin with fiber reinforcement compressive strength of psi it density of in therefore the height for section column just support itself be million inch or ft or mile now structure will either truss type or guy wire or both will be use below the crush strength let u we will of the strength this give work height of mile for section column section column be not the limit on how high you build something if you of the cross section you go up for let u you pound to support the top of the tower for simplicity in this require inch of column cross to support the weight the mile of structure below the will itself weigh lb so mile below the the be now lb the next mile of structure must be thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the mile of structure must in by the the to the bottom we see from this there be no limit on there will be limit on how much composite we to by how much you need to support on the grind for which you need the bedrock support let u choose billion the limit in costruction cost with this we lb of composite our finish structure cost the figure be just for cost then we of per mile the tower height become mile this be the rocket from the top of the tower will still to provide velocity but g-losses will be g-losses the component of rocket thrust in the direction to counter but which do not contribute to velocity thus they represent thrust together with rocket from the grind velocity to contend with this be simplify in it doe not consider wind these will require more support over the first mile of height the pressure drop to low enough for it not to be big eder investment w h box n w
