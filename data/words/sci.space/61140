from ron subject sirtf mission be still from the jpl universe sirtf be still very much in business by in these time of budget the very of number of mission be but to design refinement implement in recent month jpl telescope sirtf project consider to be in trouble couple of be well to project scientist werner lighter revise orbit shorter mission up to le expensive project with tremendous scientific power bright future werner design follow-up to the highly successful cosmic explorer cobe mission sirtf cool for from be schedule for in or if proceed schedule pioneer work in to view the milky never before other thing comet it provide sky survey time more sensitive previously from cobe the on new the universe but to sirtf jim jpl of physic pre-projects recently the project be to million time more on in detector however despite the enormous stride in sirtf promise the it cite the highest priority new for of in the by the of science it take diet or die directive from to keep the project go to werner the project be now know sirtf on the key in it new design the will orbit the sun of the permit the use of rocket of the formerly propose the of the orbit be you use of your for boost the you do to up second rocket to the orbit werner the other to orbit he be it in better environment from the of the in sirtf redesign include shorten the mission from five to three build be le in the sirtf will weigh pound to sirtf pound of up to le stressful environment werner cost of more million for the in to in the design of the le werner sirtf redesign result of congress tell you try to do too thing if you u to support sirtf which be good project develop to see how it fit into shortly sirtf highest priority scientific mission by the science committee in to the bless from the of science while the it instrument require descoping to keep the project sirtf scientific contribution promise to come from it detector which will to be develop ten of of time before to up until couple of werner do with single detector or very of detector since then the of defense develop to produce of ten or hundred of of detector just few those very well suit for use on sirtf werner note in to with budget pressure congress be currently project with eye out for spinoff on question i think we some thing to he the detector we use off development sirtf will be build by the industry it engineer in to be tremendous scientific project sirtf will be use by the entire community werner but the revise mission put premium on observe time we to the user community develop involve survey quick of the werner the of the project require reduction in scope complexity of sirtf three instrument the photometer however these reduction will only result in loss of efficiency he the project hope to b in which will provide concept for development design build the would begin two project cost million million i very optimistic sirtf he it will provide tremendous return for the investment werner benefit from the project will be the enrichment of our environment people on the street very interest in hole the possibility of life on other the origin of the universe those the kind of question sirtf will help ron jet propulsion telos the from new be
