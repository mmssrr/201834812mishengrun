from wiml lewis subject re fluid loss doug loss write besides the problem of move so dense medium in out of the lung etc be there likely to be problem with the mixture i since the lung never expel the in them the to mix pretty quickly with the in the lung to provide useful pressure of oxygen right would this mix be the pressure we there interest in scientific some time liquid it few month before the out i remember they mention three thing be difficult to do once with substitute fluid low viscosity if it too difficult to force the fluid in out of the lung you enough oxygen to power your own effort let else diffusion obviously not the in your lung be expel when you out the be expel be the the of the so the trip from the blood vessel to the new to be do by diffusion of the through the fluid oxygen tend to diffuse more so even if you get enough oxygen in you might not be to get enough out you to be to dissolve enough per unit volume oh of course your new fluid must not the lung or interfere with their or like wim lewis wiml
