from subject re burster where they in steinly steinn sigurdsson write this doe not propose for grbs in the oort no doe not fit the i big difference ignore the question of how you fit distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution be not well know in comet which not well know not good of the oort cloud distribution merge neutron be with the right energy except it doe why there be no with or structure there be no for get the energy out in with of there will be lot of production which which the energy it trouble enough energy to the most powerful burst erg it too to the burst it be to of neutron mechinism be the conversion of neutron to or the merger of two but us pretty physic my point be we do good so grb likely to be by unknown so we rule out the oort cloud would be the spectrum of event which convert comet to the for hole comet comet collide with comet quite right but there be which modify the spectrum the energy very well for both of these to trevor week if the meteorite hole collision with the then there likely to be enough hole the for bh-comet collision the grb well the we do know the distribution of comet in the oort cloud be to rule them out it it to rule them out the point of the cite if we they get the right distribution for the oort cloud it be but not impossible to up with the distribution of grb if they get the wrong distribution for the oort cloud they oort cloud grb executive we do know enough to rule out out the oort cloud
