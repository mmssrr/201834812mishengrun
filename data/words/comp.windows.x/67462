from subject rx remote execution of x i post this few week but i get error pnews permission deny yep mode of with renew interest in set the etc i think i would post my contribution this perl script be my solution it try to be intelligent it do so you should be to type rx get xterm run on with the difficult stuff of in theory this do everything you ever to do when you to run remote in the it doe even need to be x try rx for for on the remote for more full list of the file line below comment welcome this be shell remove before this line then it by it into file type sh file to overwrite exist
