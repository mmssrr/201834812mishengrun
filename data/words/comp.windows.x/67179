from rgooch gooch subject re with in dcr derek c write i just implement this it seem i just the sec on ipx i get with sunview though it bite choppy time the then it into be bite cumbersome so the be slower to with sunview be there better to in the rgooch gooch write if you need speed your client run on the host the x server you should use the memory extension to the x server mit-shm xdpyinfo will tell you if your server this extension this be with the mit x server run under sunos word of sure your kernel be configure to support memory word of openwindows be slower the mit server i write tool use xview for the gui by the which yield over per second for bite run on ipc the cpu grunt of ipx this prove quite sufficient for gooch memory mention by nkissebe nick kisseberth look interest but i need someone to point me to some be this method likely to give better result server resident i be interest in look the xview code mention for the help so if i get something decent put together i definitely post it to the net the mit come with write by keith on the memory extension to x look in i find this there be bite of work to set up the memory segment from it etc there be extension query to determine if the server support it but you still need to test if the server be run on the host if memory be in the kernel i write of convience routine which this for the xview code well i doubt would be consider interest the interest stuff be do in c object people interest in this code me gooch rgooch
