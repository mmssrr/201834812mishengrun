openwindows be windowing environment conform to the open look user it with the window system from mit well currently sun news sunview so you intermix write for of those system it come from sun with system v from vendor openwindows be sometimes openwin or xnews the use to it the itself respectively it should not be window or look or openlook these term either wrong or to something else openwindows source licence cost for the server plus for deskset for the current version of openwindows for sunos on sun sunos on sunos on see mix openwindows where i get it olit xview tnt these toolkits for to use in develop conform to the open look see the for on the toolkits here brief olit t open look intrinsics toolkit for the x window system it use widget set the for people who be to you could buy the source from t you do get the version tht sun ship sun include the olit in openwindows it be often include in system v it write in c the of olit in openwindows olit olit support to usl then division of t now own by novell who it with moolit note of the of xt you will or need olit source in order to develop or else us see the proceed of the x conference xview be sun toolkit for write in c xview be in to sunview there even shell script to help source code from sunview to xview xview be often to be the toolkit to if you not with x window the xview toolkit be include in openwindows full source be by ftp from elsewhere the current version of xview from sun be despite rumour to the some even from within sun the xview toolkit be not to be drop by sun xview will be include in the next of openwindows unlike news on the other the xview toolkit be not likely to receive much from sun in the future olit the news toolkit tnt object-oriented system on the postscript news tnt implement of the open look component require to build the user of it currently include in openwindows the current version of tnt from sun be some with tnt tnt but sun commit to support the until they stop news support some time this it with postscript you might be commit to in this context the seem to be it nothing sun currently it be commit to olit however the c user toolkit uit consist of object-oriented c on top of xview tool to code from devguide gil file the uit include simplify event the use of postscript color it be to be with openwindows since the mention it work on uit be not sun-supported product but ongoing project of people within sun it be find on in the mit contrib directory use mode where doe motif fit in it doe motif be user be be develop by osf it look feel reminiscent of microsoft window the there no non motif toolkits the motif source be sell by osf motif be currently on more openwindows the open look gui be use on more simply sun such sun volume for improve motif by convert them to olit there note in the periodic olit demo be moolit moolit be version of olit from let user choose between motif open look ui feel run-time it will be of system v jo postscript thing sun sun will include the dp extension to x in the next of openwindows dp be design on top of slow level postscript interpreter intend to give very subset of the of news whilst be to use i it the only it over news be the be much be le complete dp be on more kind of on our be not for work it will be like on the to be see note font by both subsystem the dp extension to x doe not type postscript font to it be not like on pc in this there be one version which doe font however subject window olwm olvwm olwm olvwm they window window be the of the x window system be responsible for decide how to out window on the screen for the user with the window olwm be the open look window it include with of the openwindows you get the source by ftp since sun it olvwm be version of olwm desktop hence the v in it it show little on the screen with the currently represent by little you move by the or with the key this let you run client move the from one to the other olvwm derive from the openwindows olwm by scott you need to xview to compile it get olvwm from ftp site such in the contrib directory there three i use my window with openwindows of olwm yes if you use twm for or mwm you wo be to use the pin unpin of olwm you wo see the footer some window use to if you use twm you to use the function to unpin menu get rid of do quit button when not run under olwm for twm put this
