from me subject font problem font problem on his new mips when he first log on xdm he single xterm window with the mwm window run in this x window xdvi work fine however if he open up second xterm suddenly xdvi not in either window give the error to iso font the only difference between the two xterm window be the one reference different in the xsession file with prettier colour other slight further show only open xterm this more x no longer font if they invoke from the line in either window if i the xterm with different font use the fn option no problem it would seem the xterm be font which somehow the server to lose of it font note xlsfonts in either window show of the font so there doe to be problem in the font other rewrite the xterm file to use different font hope for the best doe more info this be the most recent mips i believe with the most current system run it be not mwm the problem occur under twm etc
