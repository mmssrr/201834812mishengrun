register some book the current of xt to procedure in the order in which they register the doe not such sequence document the volume do the order be undefined the list be by both the widget the xt not the order of execution in the procedure should be think of independently of one should not depend on side-effects of other if seqence be need then the single to be register explicitly other function to converse subject why doe xtdestroywidget destroy the widget xtdestroywidget in two in order to structure the the widget which be not destroy until your return to it event-loop subject how do i

be user of best off use the function which will work on both widget non-widget object if you still use you use this simple bite of code to do you note it depend on the widget structure be not to future version of xt include include include string widget widget widget will work with non-widget object return widget modify with suggestion by rogers subject why do i get error to xtwindow widget i do this in order to get window into which i do xlib within my window xtwindow get the window with the widget window produce error the window with the widget be of the of the widget use window id of null no window could the error you describe it be to before to use the window with widget note the window will be the but the server not it yet so you should for expose event on the window before into it subject why do i get error when the error occur if the specify go off the edge of the screen if you do to the error with it you the follow step to the error the the you to the to use use to copy the window to the if you get noexpose event the copy use to the from the if you get one or more event the copy the member of the event structure tell you the of the which good get rid of the it lot of memory to oliver jones oj subject how my tell if it be be run under x number of offer x mode but otherwise run in mode the for to determine it be run on x be to to open connection to the x server if do x stuff else do curse or something else where be either the string specify on the follow by convention or otherwise be null in which us the of if set this be superior to simply check for the existence or check for set in the environment neither of which be subject how do i busy cursor while my be compute be it to xdefinecursor for every window in my the thing to do be to single inputonly window be the possible screen it child of your toplevel window it will be clip to window so it wo other it need to be big the possible screen in the user the window while it be busy or move elsewhere within desktop substitute toplevel with your top-most widget here code should work for xlib-only just use your top window unsigned long ignore device event while the busy cursor be cwcursor toplevel the window will be big the screen clip by it own window so we never to worry toplevel xtwindow toplevel unsigned int inputonly where the could be by the of the screen to server which problem with window when you to use this busy cursor this window to go to it this will keep you from get mouse event depend on precisely how the window work it or not effect on keystroke well in note most of the widget support xtncursor resource which be reset should you merely wish to the cursor without block pointer event to heller mouse subject how do i fork without my x which off other unix process which continue to run it be close doe not until of it child the child inherit from the the open x connection to the you need to do be fork then in the child process close connectionnumber widget to close the file-descriptor in the this do your exec you will then be to exit the before this which the file descriptor to be close on exec void fcntl connectionnumber to gordon greg holmberg holmberg subject i xt or xlib from no xlib xt no exclusion for protect section if your such the wrong time which might be while the function you be execute it the in inconsistent note the c point out of be undefined if the function other itself so this be not problem specific to xlib xt the posix mention other function which be but it not be these function by xlib or xt function you work the problem by set in the interrupt check it with work procedure or timer event which previously be note the in the x the in volume in error to pete converse converse subject these xlib sequence lose error you see these error if you issue xlib request from xlib error or more likely if you which x request to xt or xlib from which you should be do in subject how my xt socket pipe or file input it very common to need to write xt input both from user the x connection from some other file descriptor but which efficiently without block on either the x connection or the other file descriptor solution be use you open your file descriptor use to register input the input will be every time there be something on the file descriptor require your write the input like you would other xt so it doe it work quickly return it be to use only non-blocking system in your input most input the file descriptor you input write or exception condition if you wish be when you register input to from disk file you will find the function be even when there be input pending be work it be suppose to the input be whenever the file descriptor be to be not only when there be new to be disk file unlike pipe or socket be to be however if only you spin to the begin you before the result be your function will be every time there be to get the type of you expect this line to the begin of your function to test whether there be new if ioctl fd n n return but this be frequently your be effectively in you be better off not use set timer in the timer procedure check the file for input courtesy heller mouse ollie jones oj subject how do i button event for widget you do this use xsendevent it likely you not set the window field in the event which xt need in order to to the widget which should receive the event if you send event to your own then you use this be more efficient xsendevent in you round-trip to the server depend on how well the widget write you be to it procedure in order to get the effect you courtesy subject why doe when i run this simple whitepixel xselectinput you right to the window before into it however the window be not to be into until it on the screen until your receive expose event do before will not you see code like this in this code would window while do xnextevent switch expose on expose event note there be second problem some xlib do set up the context to correct color so this could previously include this code note the code us whitepixel to be be white or the between pixel the color white be they be reverse or they not even correspond to white note use whitepixel be the wrong thing to do in finish it ignore the user preference for foreground note you run into the in if you into the xtwindow w right it be it not yet subject be the difference between screen screen the be xlib structure

unless the single-click be such you defer it until you next see event from the server thus you to do timeouts which system-dependent code on most unixish you use xconnectionnumber to get the file
