from inoue inoue subject how to see from we develop toolkit run on the x window system the toolkit cope with on you know there kind of from mit xsi ximp our of the toolkit us xsi our toolkit on our own font system in order to do the type string must be decompose to set this if one type compound string with mix for be give element of the must be check it correspond set on bite environment in this if the be will be either to or so we need function to do this the function must check how from the top the set the set be we could not find public function to do use xsi function to construct function the follow be the source code of function this look like c code but it be c id v exp ifndef define include extern int const in int in buf out int buflen int out out extern xmstring const extern const wc endif id v exp include include include include extern c include define define xmbfscs define xmbctidtocsid include undef undef xmbfscs undef xmbctidtocsid extern int const int int int int extern xmbfscs csid extern csid xmbctidtocsid csid int const in int in buf out int int out out int ctid int buf ctid if success xmbfscs xmbctidtocsid ctid null else null return include file be xsi we copy the file to the toolkit directory compile serious issue occur when we try to compile toolkit on our hp with it o version of when we try to link on our toolkit link error occur the follow function miss xmbctidtocsid code xmbfscs code code code we use mit version of it xsi until successfully one of the to use xsi hp do not hp until the o we no to know how hp would be implement we hop xsi use it function the hp linker there no xsi function implement we observe from hp they use some ximp but we not sure if they use mit ximp version or their own version of ximp therefore find just counter function in mit ximp for xsi doe not seem to u solution my question be to know how we construct function like list be there function to check set of element of type string depend on if it be public function be perfect but even if it be not we to use function in hp we do for mit in order to render type string there must be some to judge set be how the proper font select for the string we no to find out without hp source file we to know how we use for our help or comment would be highly i if tell me ximp this even if it be not hp you inoue inoue electric open system
