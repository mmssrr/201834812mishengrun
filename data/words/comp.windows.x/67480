from rich subject re on pc network in write in support support write in write sort of be with the i curious to find out the require link must if one run be support multiple user client we require response time i expect the limit will be your server not the network itself to give you here we roughly people use dvx to to bunch of unix box novell file server other it not too much of on our ethernet with so you people on segment if you net or the you to run be very network intensive you could run into some slowdown but the biggest problem would be the itself you with plenty of disk network if you people run off it you go to see some slowdown you now on effectively of course dvx will to see if idle sure they give up their time slice but if you work run you know it well i buy bigger more powerful server of the drop in price the link i to use though isdn be costly the limit why my interest lie in see if such link be use see go through it since i do think tom get time to this group i the liberty of respond to some of this if you tom to reply you should send to support line be go to restrict you more the ethernet we run how restrictive it will be depend on you run how you run it i would think couple of of some like smoke clover would the link useless for else on the other xclocks quietly every second or so would it too much in the world you will be somewhere in between these two extreme go by the i use x on i would to to link with more other people if you the be run by in to give up time slice when idle sort of thing you could run people on give before you see slowdown this time from network hmmm your centre monitor the you run ms-windows like word sort of go through link do you or be the flow go through your network or do you few high then low point our be unique other the not very good predictor of how yours will the only one of our low link get use in this be link to they often use to run do text client end of client-server remotely from the dvx behind me since the server end be or this end it be to remotely run the client desqview x short hop to the server run the client long hop to the server i you this tell u very little how you will fill isdn link run word for window remotely be go to itself be very dependent let it into piece look it the mouse pointer be efficient to from window into x pop up menu be little more involve will some restore the screen cover by menu be not be doe the server it on store if so the server enough memory the be will little network if no store then be cover up if it solid color of we tell your xserver to quite if it full color of ren stimpy we to send it to the x server bite by bite dvx will do it level best to only but in some the entire screen need to be screen with bite per pixel bite to be send worst possible you look second in it would never be this since the screen will will be into higher level x it depend on the do ie you go to see slowdown from lot sooner if your do network thing do you by network thing i vision use m window other window over the network be the process run on the server i get the i wonder how good be the x subsequently protocol in these with them on client x design from the grind up to be efficient network it pretty good for this x best do text good since we conert them to x something like winx be hybrid we intercept the window to it driver mouse driver driver convert them to x the window be in no design to be efficient on switch network we go to lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level xlib we but we limit we only know window it tell u office system rich problem resolution dept ftp site for write to info info question support bb
