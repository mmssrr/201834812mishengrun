from robert subject v hp deskjet hello week i post query look for people feel on the inkjet of printer between the bubblejet the deskjet people me to post the of the post i receive below be my query the response i receive i not delete of the response only the so you you find some people me for however the very of the question suggest comment you must the you believe of printer there wide of comment it own there no winner some like the it others prefer the of the deskjet the inkjet with prove driver solid two new inkjet printer some new printer to be introduce by this summertime to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find the the cost of re-filling or the ink the this depend on where you the re-fills or so shop first since this will most likely the cost of your printer no one mention how sheet ink will print but i suspect they roughly sheet printer will do sheet per toner well brief of my enjoy hello fellow i for your collect wisdom to help me decide which printer i should the bubblejet v the hp deskjet i think trust the i would benefit more from rely on those who use these printer use them to their fullest i figure of you will know their benefit better now i would you could render on the dpi of the bubblejet v the deskjet dpi which be be there print difference in which will document better or more experience on either will be here which work better under window driver problem etc cost of memory font toner etc your experience with either of these be highly both good well i buy the bj month the of their on printer it end i buy it from computer discount their price of could be i look i think it hot printer just use copier produce result just in high mode i the output of designer with type do on my bj with the print on hp iid i how well i could the print on the bj print speed second on the bj which be consider the hp i the time from when the printer first it receive i use print in window i show the output to people work one buy one for his office two other engineer their order too if you need cdw phone number it delivery to ny two good luck witkowski electronics inc glen rock nj i own deskjet be under window use truetype font but neither be the from i see for the hp be very much dependent on on photo-copy the slightly edge but on better type thing look better for most i find copy fine still better come with window driver which seem to print few hp font truetype but try them out get font but unless the speed of truetype be problem i would bother the be use buffer soft font only for bmp etc the hp be put into dither mode the hp supply win driver there number of dither option such etc the give depend on the type of be print text be not so good in this mode problem when you document which both text the of tone for be but i think be more of with inkjet printer in from i see the be in most respect however printer definitely worth look be the new inkjet from epson this printer be of produce on copier remember the model lx something i think i my hp before the epson here the introductory price on the epson the the hp here in new month i get i love it it be incredibly except for print from pspice i do know if you ever do stuff with or not most of the stuff i print be either from microsoft word for window or just text the only problem i print the printer out print on lot of copy work with it you only tell it not by hold it oh le twelve inch from your be if you like me the printer come with it own driver for window i no other the printer just like some epson or for those write driver for it yet the teeny-weeny footprint be plus too if you it between now you get from i buy mine from store the price now be i friend who the hp you look it print very well everyone driver for it but it be very slow hope i help sure look in witkowski write in robert write hello fellow i for your collect wisdom to help me decide which printer i should the bubblejet v the hp deskjet i think trust the i would benefit more from rely on those who use these printer use them to their fullest i figure of you will know their benefit better question delete well i buy the bj month the of their on printer it end i buy it from computer discount their price of could be i look i think it hot printer just use copier produce result just in high mode i the output of designer with type do on my bj with the print on hp iid i how well i could the print on the bj print speed second on the bj which be consider the hp i the time from when the printer first it receive i use print in window i guess i some experience with both i work deskjet home i prefer the deskjet the print speed i test both with text before buy the deskjet for home the set the deskjet be the driver support in so the bj end up the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with non-windows this will be the for long time the design be superior if you just to use cut the deskjet be quieter the ink quite bite due to the number of deskjets out there in to the bjs just my worth mike group of box luling internet yes there be the mode print problem but it doe not present problem in window the window printer driver the i think of some other point i post the note the deskjet of the the bubblejet doe not you right the resolution i test the printer with the i to wordperfect wingif pro could not tell difference in one of the hp deskjet window driver give you control over the density of the printer hence control the of ink you put down the bubblejet do not i no to test the printer with so no there i sheet feed in the bubblejet cost more the deskjet i go through pretty thorough choose the deskjet when i spend my own money btw i the with deskjet work this month mike group of luling i spend some time the two we end up get the bubblejet versus the hp our be the hp seem to worse the versus we felt we could see the difference price go on the moment the our choice over the we could in the feeder the hold only i think you see up to on the we do big with the bj but it seem under window i know the microsoft bb newer window driver come with the printer but i do know how it the driver include with the printer be i do know where the microsoft bb one come from microsoft hope this help v tvf uunet uupsi tvf tvf the itself i sometimes if i not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the the print be bite better but you you get much more possiblities do forget the hp engine be on the the engine witch be use in other new bubblejet printer like the epson one be quite recently now i would you could render on the dpi of the bubblejet v the deskjet dpi which be be there print difference in which will document better i see during short from someone who try to sell me printer time the picture one print with the one with the the other with the hp there difference in print the bite better kris when we decide we need quiet printer in our we look to inkjet printer they speed they quiet we use both hp deskjets the i prefer the of the deskjets but i feel the superior print the would be with sheet feeder however i do end up buy deskjet for home use get too good we use in high volume they hold up very well out of deskjets i only one problem with deskjet of very quickly by hp whenever i buy i look the expert pick out the top few then buy on the most i be flush no beg letter so i do this few time include four month with inkjet printer i remember much the process except i three review of inkjets the or the top i buy the of the dimension of colour i intend to build multi some just buy colour i use the colour thing in yet i try it out on couple of window i with the result i note even though you now get the the one with both colour mono with no need to the the still in the uk the follow my i do know the except i from review reply to post to yours with the the hp offer the best i believe hp the in the field not the to be but the still young so one they the expertise the be worth the in mono be perfectly i get good crisp reproduction of font from window i use to work for monotype when they still typesetter before their owner close them down i tell you in term of definition dpi be pretty poor so dpi be just bite le poor the hp come with set of driver if you buy it invest in the it pretty slow with it god know it like without i work in my pc be home in the uk so it not in use i would from my not the properly dumb problem the it to hope this be of use just buy the i think the price could be with thru so it be even superior to the deskjet in print speed per seem to be i do figure i do print long doc though i think the be excellent print be excellent well unless you use font hold it up close you see lot more on the dpi be offset by little le in hold the in i would doc not room in the model for whole up to though try it driver no problem under yet winword doe to print the envelope the the doe though know nothing of cost me the deskjet be slow this be in to the other printer i mention i no how the bubblejet the between the printer be just i not problem with it i just buy printer couple of i it to the print of hp deskjet know the hp for me the be pretty print with good i it with the hp iiid postscript they look depend on the kind of i do problem with the ink not be dry it seem to dry very within second since be give until the end of it be good buy eckton computer support college of fine wow it funny you should this i little behind in news so i know this be i just the bubblejet night i worry i would like it but the print noise level be i print quite few document with lot of it print you tell it not unless you get inch from the no problem with driver the printer with the driver diskette which be good i begin to when i could findi it under window or wordperfect it work well under both i yet to word for window so do know how it work with them i deskjet work it good printer well ut i felt it slow much noisier the bubblejet i wo the bubblejet be much better but i do like it more just my worth brett sincerely robert or in theory theory the in they not you you the revise revision of the revise revision revise
