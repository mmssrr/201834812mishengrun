from yuki ito subject re doe the bmp in l robert write doe the window look like i how be the store width height no of colour i could find in th user be there other reference which would give me this from newsgroups subject guide request keywords dib bmp file dec gmt sender news electronics rochester ny line xref guide to of dib b electronics rd rochester ny copyright the of for use by m window be document in the m window reference guide this guide be intend some word of the to put forth the send revision to me me for write this on my own time by keep my with the document you for your respect this document copyright by b if desire postscript version of this document be this be free you get more you for do sue me if i wrong overview the dib file be intend to be device independent file microsoft by device independent be to me four pixel resolution support bite bite bite bite pixel these be intend for use on do ibm or system if you them on you will to byte short long integer by convention dib end in the extension bmp this be they super-set of file consequently you will sometimes dib file refer to bmp file since dib file super-set there three of dib o do dib these the recommend convention the form which i will describe how to they intend for run under m window in do environment o dib my be these the of dib be use by the o old-style difference between the do dib consist of file which identify the file dib file this give the of the file the offset to the which specify the of color use by the if it exist this or entry entry be window structure the itself the dib consist of the file which identify the file dib file this give the of the file the offset to the which specify the of color use by the if this exist it or entry entry be window rgbtriple structure the itself the old style consist of either or which type be determine by the first long integer dword color this be compose of either window structure if the or window rgbtriple structure if the the itself dib file do dib file consist of step the need to be then write to the file these structure define in the m include file need to be store for not the five step fill in the the structure the if the be or the color of the file put this in the field of the the offset to the from the of the file put this in the bfoffbits field of the write to the file the the the color the in order the follow section describe structure in term of microsoft c type define keywords the follow describe these keywords for those not with microsoft c type-defined keywords in microsoft c typedef byte unsigned word two byte unsigned integer dword four byte unsigned integer the this structure be define in typedef struct word bftype dword word word dword bfoffbits the bftype field be the two this serf to identify the file dib file on intel byte order ibm or this be form in c the on intel system the field be the of the file for our purpose this field be to the of the plus the of the plus the number of entry in the color time the of plus the number of byte of if the be be write out in uncompress form this be of time otherwise this field need to be fill in both the the field set to the bfoffbits field be set to the offset to the of the from the of the file for our purpose this field should be set to the of the plus the of the plus the number of entry in the color time the of this work out the be write write the color if one exist the this structure be define in typedef struct dword dword biwidth dword biheight word word bibitcount dword bicompression dword dword bixpelspermeter dword biypelspermeter dword biclrused dword the field be set to the of the structure itself when the file this be be use to determine the not the biwidth field be the width of the in pixel the biheight field be the height of the in line the field should be set to this be write out if there one color the bibitcount field be the bit-depth of the this must be either or depend on the bit-depth of the the bicompression field tell how the be compress if it be compress dib support two form of run-length encode however i never see which use it do know yet how it work set this field to long or to the be not compress subsequent field of the structure be set to requirement of the interpretting it be to compute these field from the previous the field which you might to explicitly specify might be biclrused for this field not of the possible color entry use the biclrused color if you use only color with then you only to of the possible entry set this field to color entry of color be structure the structure be define in the include file typedef struct byte rgbblue byte rgbgreen byte rgbred byte rgbreserved the rgbreserved field be for color use the of blue green red fill into the structure the structure be write to the file of in the rgbblue rgbgreen or rgbred field component doe not contribute to the color composition of in of these field the component contribute fully to the color composition there three surprise the order of in dib file the of this determine to be within the line write out be to the next four byte so if you which only one pixel wide you still to write out four byte for every line the number of byte per line be or in term of the field of the structure biwidth bibitcount when write out your you must write it out bottom line first the bottom line of the you would look it on the screen be the first line of in the file for be write you would expect one bite eight pixel to byte four bite two pixel to byte eight bite write one pixel per byte twenty-four bite write three byte per pixel however for the must be write out in the order blue green red while most file write out in rgb order dib file write the out in bgr order this should provide enough to dib from such or for export routine if you find out more dib the on to me so i modify this document b rochester ny kindness senseless of ito yuki senior of science of science university of tokyo
