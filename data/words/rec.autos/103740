from swett ssbc subject re review ford sho excerpt from re review ford by w rice in id bond write gk i trouble shift into reverse the shifter gk refuse to enter the i often grind the synchro try to gk get it into i be this in the next couple gk of month enter second then go into reverse they use the synchro you never i ground-em-to-fit when use this technique or do like the put it in first then you quickly go into reverse no one more which work in i drive it be my the other suggestion but try this one too while push the shifter gently reverse let the clutch out slowly right to the friction point the shifter will be pull into position if you do it right the wo jump nor will the grind you will just glide
