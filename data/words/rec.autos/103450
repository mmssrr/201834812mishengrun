from eliot eliot subject review it be while since i review but i visit to old friend whose love for be so overwhelm he not too sucessful live sell them without further i will get to the servotronic steer for those who not with servotronic be it be the for the speed power steer by use in bmws i be outspoken in my of servotronic over the couple of month this on review drive of the c the fwd i quite to report now on the the servotronic be inoffensive i suppose due to the tire the servotronic be up more this so be the best i try it be from perfect mind you i be much if it option i could refuse but on the i no longer consider this to be enough where i feel the entire be ruin the steer be still too light but it be i suppose the stiffly spring send so much some it through to the driver so there be feel there be in the steer but there be room for improvement i consider the steer to be better the competition the do not believe in feel engineer it out completely engine wheee pressure cooker with just mile on the clock i do not expect the to be produce close to it will be put out mile but still the terrific punch for it be very in it drive low rev high it be so supremely flexible one could believe there only liter of to move this pound in such with torque rpm rpm redline the pretty much be leave in third which to speed of something like mph one with the be throttle response be right up there with good engine in it would even put engine to downshift it be more fun to use the overboost to rev the engine for those not the engine up to second of turbo boost for sort of like light up the burner in jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third the from to in just few moment simply by floor the the number go torque in overboost mode shoot up to lb ft incredible for liter it few moment for it to develop overboost but it be well worth for since this be quite one body not fling like the the be smooth strong to rid in jetliner it down the on one be to very distinctive whistle from the turbo the only sound to come out of very refine but sound yes refine the to the point where rpm it sound serene it doe the smoothness be but not quite up to the of very good bmw i in term of refinement willingness to rev smoothness of under full it be better however lose in the refinement process be the cylinder the older engine so if not terribly refine the turbo sound pretty except for the whistle under full boost subjectively i the vw engine be more the turbo own be more with rorty growl when press though none of these it grunt the only hint of the engine true occur when one be off from rest the turbo come to stop with the from the system one to be in feed in the clutch to prevent one could use more rev in both very price to for such engine i think of should offer option for this just they offer though in extremely number speed for the much the of the engine perfect for in europe slush be but none be offer for the of the slush twit their ugly i notice tend to very wide wheel modest tire width the come with firestone of which be not uncommon however the very speak wheel no le inch wide so there be no bulge combine with the wheel the mouth yet subdue look on rough concrete it become the new body style in rigidity well noise suppression i suppose the two but i digress to use cliche the body feel like it be out of stone flex be even when go over rough with super rigid body like this stiff spring stiff do not excessive while the ride will never worry lexus it will not to truck or pony the servotronic steer be mention i consider it to be inoffensive it do not inhibit spirit corner i to test the corner power without too much i think new concept be work in this with it tire understeer or oversteer be on on i go in slow power i go i could feel the g force build to the point where the skin on my be tug yet the completely obedient to throttle steer input it felt the limit be not even close to be the g force be thrill but the entire of go curve be uninvolving you tell the you it doe it end of story i think i to more more to those reviewer who be highly impress by the nsx efficiency but be to in love with the the very good firmness to them stop the pretty well too though i they prone to i not too surprise since the doe not over the fwd would help but in turn would to more wooden response when cold i to see trend the where weight be not be offset by the be nothing to neither be the or the legend these seem to be forget virtue when everybody be focus on comfort for with such sporty it comfort level excellent the be with insert in of the wood trim of the the expect there power memory power this the ommision the trip computer which remove get it to work yet the no boost into how much the turbo it for the the come with style moonroof well the very intelligent switch noise level include engine tire noise be so low i would consider the lexus in this to be enough to buyer conclusion even though few will be to it sticker price of the be if one into it to offer over the competition the turbo be gem even if it doe produce sound no other offer the utter security of wheel drive which to some be worth the money by itself the top notch side the very belt tensioners the the series be in government test it get my thumb up for be so overwhelmingly be out excite eliot
