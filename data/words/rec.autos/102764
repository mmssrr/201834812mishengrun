from welty welty subject frequently question this be one of of commonly question the other question more to the so be not crossposted to rpw of revise fluid section non-silicone fluid now rpw commonly question tire question q do the funny number on the side of my tire you will see something like the be the width of the tire in millimeter the be the be the it the height of the of the tire to the width our tire height of mm the be the wheel in inch there some tire trx tire which three digit metric wheel like which be in millimeter the r the h be speed the highest speed which the tire when properly common speed s t h v up to recent to the method for specify tire move the speed to different of the you therefore find like the the per-tire with the speed exceed this in continuous the speed be follow be show number of index correspond per-tire index kg note the v weight confusion occur in this in some the letter p or lt be find in front of tire the lt light truck the p if no letter be give then the of the tire be i know these letter only in the u the lt be of interest to owner of light truck other utility vehicle for the owner of vehicle there be no difference between tire with p one with no if the be omit it be but be tire with m their speed reduce by there be set of on tire for b c with the best c the worst be numeric these of limit they by tire thus not useful in different of tire q my tire with funny i put tire on the your tire trx tire they be devise by michelin of different design they with tire michelin use different wheel for them so they could not be mount on the wrong type wheel so more tire could not be mount on trx type wheel you will need to different wheel to put tire on your it be possible to fit tire on trx wheel horribly to do so the tire simply peel off the rim in corner or possibly blow out high speed trx type tire become to find in to michelin tire discontinue their line of trx tire q i from side to side or them only on one side of my tire differ view on this subject between the leave right side of be now ok this group include michelin others for pirelli will void if such be do the best be to your tire before your tire stick to the q how snow tire should i buy if i buy which end of the should i put them on in short both end to driver in do get excessive snow or who do drive or in snow condition get with only two snow on the drive wheel but there where this be with wheel drive you choose between be to the go function of the or stop turn the function of the front in front wheel drive you stop turn with the front end the risk of put the snow tire on the front only be if you to put on the while go downhill you run serious risk of go downhill detector speed limit q why there comment on detector speed limit in this q post question detector speed limit crossposted between long tedious pointless if you to either of these topic subscribe to or keep it there equipment q do work suggest the follow work much better no belt good point belt work much better point belt work slightly better point belt the con to be some design tend to burn the driver when vent the byproduct of the explosion occur inside the some design but not knock the driver from the wheel retention of control of the vehicle the more difficult question q do i need to get the rotor on my disk turn to do this no there specific condition turn or rotor some shop try little money by rotor more often be strictly if the rotor not only lightly groove then there be no need to or to turn them note some rotor the rotor on good so to begin with it be not to turn them they must be when they become too thin or groove q they tell me i should downshift when to slow my down be this good it use to be very good in the of mediocre prone drum in modern disc equip use of downshifting to slow the be not except in of long steep downhill run otherwise modern disc more to stop in they much to clutch line on the other driver license test in the still specify the driver be test downshift under i suggest before u driver test you either to do this smoothly which some time or borrow with to the test q how often should i my fluid more often you do fluid tend to this corrode of the system lower the boil point of the fluid type older fluid newer the difference in wet dry boil point the dry boil point be in fresh fluid but the wet boil point be in older fluid fluid the lowest wet dry boil point requirement fluid better boil point requirement fluid the best boil point requirement but fluid not superior see the next q for more while the requirement imply fluid better fluid there be specific where fluid be but these mostly competition otherwise type fluid offer much improve feel once be recommend for fluid driver profit by out fluid more frequently or bleed modest of fluid out of the q fluid this down in to two the look excellent for but the first fluid be silicone silicone fluid tricky proposition unlike fluid they do not while this sound like the problem be present pool up in such system interfere with corrode the spot where the pool be occur the will tend to in the system to the where most of the corrosion occur of this phenomenon it be when convert to silicone to empty the entire system flush it throughly some even recommend rubber in the system when convert to silicone fluid two other issue come up with silicone fluid they difficult to pour be without bubble which interfere with get good feel while they much higher boil point fluid they do high mode which in effect from boil fluid silicone fluid sense in some street but they not recommend for high drive the economics for street use i recently become of new fluid meet the do not silicone these fluid to be with the older fluid but i little this time q be on some of the i look but it cost more be it worth it this doe not cut dry therefore this will be quite long in order to cover the pro con the short be cost more both to will work better for the driver be to driver who doe not extensive experience in high drive technique require the of some obsolete technique like pump which should be in now for the long work by monitering the wheel of the look for sign of lock it or not be be to distinguish between the different wheel there system on the it not detect impend lockup which be you would in world but only the existence of lockup the sensor use some of the le well design sensor sensitive to tire to to function properly if the owner from equipment or component when the sensor detect lockup the system respond by unlock the either or once depend on the system if the driver keep their foot firmly the will end up cycle between the lock unlock if sensor exist could detect impend lockup then we could sit right point which be where effect be this pulse often be felt in the the system cycle the of the time the truly be the duty cycle in system this be on dry driver this duty cycle quite use technique threshold on wet be so will outperform threshold every time on mud on snow often effect be with the lock only of the produce see fit to provide switch for the system for this of be it preserve steer control this be the simply if you the limit turn the wheel the will the if it see steering-triggered lockup off on the of the time the will lengthen not exceed the force in give if you slide on ice do expect system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction be not by the presence of system in your go in to the restriction i list you to worry the follow cost much higher the oe cylinder for my obscure list for but the oe cylinder for the version of the list for over most explicitly forbid use of silicone fluid in vehicle of the cost of of corrode system component i suggest of fluid become very q this threshold business i not put this in the consumer q but recent publicity number of involve police driver in chevy suggest this section be need here rpw threshold be technique by serious high driver if it the the lock up entirely be much to be prefer the premise be tire force when they just to slide but just before the wheel lock up entirely driver who threshold to feel this threshold feel like to for it hit it on the of the in you feel you the threshold when the to firm up you depress it in if you the tire whine just bite you not very the threshold in with often there be twinge in the just before the system cycle if the driver off on the just when the twinge be felt then they very close to the threshold they better stop if they just punch it let the over recently there be of publicity over number of one involve police equip with system the police in question quickly the new system but to it now seem the problem of none of the involve officer recent drive there be to believe the driver to the pulse by pump old discredit technique of the the be to try get with system if you think it for minute you pump must cut the effective of work system by so if you cut the duty cycle of system by much you give up most of your for the wrong threshold the in it be effective useful technique of whether your if you do system then one or two the will be sufficient question q doe high help not some knock sensor the engine time or boost to suit the be use on most however you should use the your run well check your owner for on your need q my for will hurt it it be possible slightly the oil otherwise the in will be however modern very little you should however check your owner from the do not require q do fuel help kind should i use some do some do during the winter it be good to use dry however some be to fuel injection system never use sometimes methyl such fuel system in with will with fuel injection opinion on sometimes ethyl if your fuel injection check the owner on your before use these most consider in with isopropyl petroleum fine in fuel inject bottle of fuel injector be helpful in with fuel injector premium detergent do the job some off of fuel injector or check the ingredient before put in your there number of good these more expensive the run-of-the-mill one but work much much better these chevron techron redline wurth lubrimoly ventil bg bottle of one of these once every six month be highly recommend q detergent the of detergent in bmw institute test which this test sticker of the test now begin to on fuel pump if such use then fuel injector while use of bmw will keep engine they not motor with deposit question q do the number letter in motor oil there different item encode there be two-letter code the type of detergent the us in the oil this look like se sf cd or such the s code for engine the c code for diesel engine the second letter be in sequence new level of protection develop thus sf be consider better se se be consider better sd so forth the more be the oil weight this be either single number weight or of number by the letter w the type be much more commonly use these the only type most specify in the first number in the be the viscosity of the oil when it be cold the w for winter the second number be the viscosity of the oil when hot there be trick here the oil doe get thicker turn from weight to weight it get hotter be be when the oil be cold it the viscosity of cold weight oil it get hotter it doe get thin oil would by the time it be up to it the viscosity of hot weight oil note these number specify of viscosity not oil the viscosity when cold not weight oil the viscosity when hot note the novel of oil be by it be report with the sole exception of gtx oil do not their well over time oil work very well though q quick lube good some do work but there quite few incompetent one out there let the buyer them while they work sure they do overtorque the oil plug keep your on your time q oil like or tufoil good tufoil of these come onto the recently they different from the be since the ptfe be the for teflon tm own by dupont in do not recommend use of these product most usenet response to question on these slight of mpg smoother rev but long term result whether ptfe effective mile some such either the product or the engine flush preceeds of the oil some bmw owner report of shortly the of slick to their this writer be by should not be use in motor it clog the oil return in the engine otherwise there no know report of by ptfe on the other there slick customer in the world q do synthetic oil work yes but more most synthetic but with the extremely long oil by oil recommend you continue to oil the recommend in the owner for your even if you decide to try the longer the oil filter synthetic get just dirty oil synthetic for entirely redline very highly very effective mobil synthetic lube get mix review however q specify longer longer oil how often should i my oil it depend on how you drive if your or get up you do drive it very keep the rev down the be fine if however you drive it drive it high rev or if you only drive it to from the so it doe get up to then you wish to oil much more often mile give most now specify mile if you do drive your much mile then you to oil every six month if you store during the winter then oil before store it oil when you bring it out of misc question q my time belt i thing when they the story it depend on the design of the motor ford escort for will suffer severe if the belt but the newer will just require tow of new belt some motor will not be but others will be if no be specify for your then the belt every mile some require more frequent your or independent if there should the time for the ford escort suffer time belt drive pump which be know to destroy the time belt which then side effect the time belt while ignore the pump be costly q why would be stupid enough to design motor so it self destruct when the time belt for compromise piston design so the piston will not collide require the compression of the engine be reduce this be why you more likely to in economy in orient vehicle q unintended the report of the conclude unintended could not be by of the vehicle in question the time be consistent with the evidence the report go on to conclude by the vehicle be the welty welty nothing good ever be report the full of either it pitch or roll smith
