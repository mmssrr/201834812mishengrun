from mjs mike sixsmith subject re post egreen ed green pixel cruncher write in mjs mike sixsmith write egreen ed green pixel cruncher write of u gyroscope etc throughly the technique of countersteering include the one who think they countersteer the through corner the underlie physic different need not be to beginner countersteering the technique should be for only with of the technique one develop effective emergency this be the only thing we on we should to i still think tell newbie to steer leave to turn to the right be confuse when they do it if they just get on the bike ride the thing i know it those other git clue me too the physic of be fine but i not see how theory like in motorcyle course you need to know be be with the tyre just begin to slide the then we in violent while you be true it be insufficient to form policy with force ie to the front wheel weight shift under force correspondingly the thus technique of both off the pressure on the front best be with of weight shift ed when you policy i think you be some weird reference to look locomotive the line here though i do my doubt it be the front be first follow by the the be you lock up the weight in i suspect most people do you describe until the tire just begin to slide be next to useless to newbie he to go out slide the tire to find out where be it give him from which to develop technique the correspond weight shift develop if you do slide the tyre you no of know whether you or not i not suggest you should to you possibly but if you to find the limit of the you to go beyond them in for if i suggest you to keep both wheel just on the point of slide then you be do you suggest
