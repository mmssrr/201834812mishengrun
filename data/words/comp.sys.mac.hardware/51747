from subject re how do they fischer write dhk write i sure intel compete for crunch-power but for give clock speed how do we the follow from to how some number here some kind of if you let me it while you it where will the follow fit into the list pentium powerpc then pentium with the first version of the powerpc somewhere in the vicinity number pentium powerpc note this be the just for clock speed doe double the clock speed double the processor speed fill in the below no computer speed be only dependent of speed memory system speed role doe video system speed speed processor clock go up the speed of the memory system become the in the system speed if you processor it be word from memory every sure you put memory in your computer but it will cost time much the slower simms not in clock-doubled system there be double in but it be quite in besides for you need i who us processor run the speed of simms note this memory speed correspond to clock speed of roughly the be twice give clock speed be the number fischer conviction more enemy of truth lie friedrich pun be no bless form of whit
