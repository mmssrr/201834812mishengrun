crime homicide in three step despite lower homicide it stricter gun gun le the second step in their seem the homicide in for the period per with in homicide be definitely more common in the question then become why the present not entirely to support the notion in the third step of their much more stringent but their evidence on the difference in gun be indirect indeed they direct evidence on the point doe not exist they offer two of in support of the gun more in but for know of the opposite could be true we therefore be the conclusion of the study to believe difference in gun the difference in homicide when difference in gun not itself be indeed the be even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bite of evidence be difference between the number of permit issue in the number of permit issue in difference between the two city in the permit render these two number strictly the second bite of evidence be cook gun index which percent for but only percent for cook index however doe not the of gun ownership in city it gun misuse it be of the of homicide suicide involve in the present the index show only in homicide suicide more likely to be use in in to cook index of it must be the involvement of gun in homicide suicide be directly to their in the but this be the seek to prove to one be seek to prove then to prove it on the of doe ot constitute scientific evidence for even if we be to on the of no compel evidence gun le common in we might still question the higher crime to higher of gun ownership but it might well be low crime or homicide reduce the for to gun in other word crime the in gun ownership not vice in it once commonly low of violent crime function of strict gun the consequent low of gun ownership until british colin greenwood find enjoy low of violent crime for before strict control be to invoke be not nor do the problem with this study end with it of direct on gun ownership the in imply they differ in gun stringency crime this be evident to the ceteris condition of sound scientific else be thing be the two city in some but closer look difference in to their respective crime or homicide the city closely in of their be white percent percent but be percent while be le percent minority be overwhelmingly so the show th two city on they not show source of be rule out in the difference in composition of the two city be in light of the study of homicide to the of the victim for the white the homicide per in in the differ homicide in the two city therefore due entirely to different minority for the observe difference in homicide be to for to complexity render the but it too be higher in in minority much more likely to be the victim of homicide in in the white be likely to be in either city since the difference in homicide between the city be due exclusively to or difference between minority group it be to why difference in gun or strigency would so to minority but not to white gun why but not white so much more likely to be kill in in study in the unite do not show or consistent difference in gun ownership or other more could the between of poverty minority to do with it the of drug or of homelessness cty minority the city of run the shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemployment young nonwhite men in the unite exceed percent be the the point be the unite differ in do city subgroup with the two country more of these might or of the difference in homicide in gross such those between else be not the of this study in homicide result in complex picture they do not the ensue complexity seriously undercut the thrust of their they socio-economic be confound in our further in slightly higher income in the rest of give the evidence present in the it be possible of the difference in homicide between result from proverty minority but the no further to this possibility since household income to be not for the difficulty confront in gross study of this sort be with simple if one be to couties them in term of of gun ownership crime or homicide one would find county with more gun le crime would one conclude from this evidence gun reduce crime or would one insist other be into in this the hide be city gun more common in town crime be big-city problem if to this or the to it possible consequence they coud be very seriously mislead in the study the two city for but not for minority poverty or other hide their result impossible to interpret in the injury for science the study two from the center for control the for scientific method to problem of public but in to conclusion from the essence of scientific method be to for the result try to rule them out such effort the result well seem scientific but little more polemic serious this study be but one of number of recent effort employ design publish in scientific be for further concern d wright be professor of sociology university he extensively on the of crime publish monthly except combine issue by the nonprofit
