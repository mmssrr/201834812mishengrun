wherever they be lose fill out the something proud mike of speak one of his best line to remind u of u holder of permit there be check certify of crime by the while the people in the behind u only to be certify of election to hold their job snow be busy out id button sheet describe the bill to be present the tell people where to find their own in too who they be mike u the committee go to suspend it rule discus bill it onto the list it seem of student from simon rock of college of lo who shoot up the with sks be buss in to testify for bill to of or to who be not resident the be schedule in the but be pre-empted by the governor on the eight woman in prison for kill seek so we until to buttonhole our which we would be into room one of my offensively he oh it must be gun the gun lobby be so every i get little piss reply i not from the gun lobby i from your district your second reporter in time to notice go on in front of the where the pro-gunners be price from the tv news there in his mirror reflective to one of the type simon rock close-the-loophole protestors cover the the room we be remember there be gun owner there plus student from one of u reserve the other never get closer the outside there crowd behind him cop take up the prevent the rest of the crowd from come in soon the set up outside in the for the benefit of everyone else everyone who there inside outside get to sign up on sheet their position on which bill most of u sign up to support position on bill first of their time public get to testify first up the bill nobody see the student some curfew i guess currently non-resident to long gun or from provide he comply with the of his own previously the but only to non-residents from the simon rock folk the current loophole it close two of their rep speak lo his sks rifle the second one hodgekiss co-sponsor do his homework so well he keep confuse lo home with missouri belligerent when five gun owner in the correct him his second muff from gloucester the new bill would put the the it but he lie the new bill by non-residents of only if they license in their own strong in since none of them do some of the thing these two be offensive in some of these other buy gun long he oooooo we some very very good gun in if only the other would the type of we would be this but they wo next up boston city he there to testify pro-gun but in some he he elderly tend to himself plus he of he the violent should be execute if he be judge he give their right pun intend on the spot which of the gun owner which bother me he the propose gun restriction be step in the right direction for the he this four time two of the bill under would police to rescind ccw or fid your gun if someone file order you note the file of order require no no no evidence no conviction just of testify in of it the pro-gunners there time by i sure the gun owner here will with me we to get these out of the of people our court convict i see such disgustingly disingenuous since nixon whine he crook speak in of the bill the fid every five of it be now the purpose be to remove fid from those who become ineligible revenue nothing to do with it right some congressman think we stupid enough to the it to process million every cycle in the hope of recent felon to simply the from conviction time the of the crook the two of the committee be rep sen do much he co-sponsor of both order bill but strike me guy would let logic or lie on the of either side to go he co-sponsor of one of the order bill well one of the younger rep on the committee forget his vociferously pro-gun so his in the right but his seem to be confine to every it the thing you come in here with this it nice to friend on the committee but he could be more effective it the could continue someone out of meet yell the cop the disturb their meet so the disconnect so they find bigger one of u to to his bus so miss the public testimony the other get this time by how he get his fid leave the then return without notify them of his he the record system not his pd in his city of birth still think he live there quote if you gun it will not get into the computer system until this he use the fid testimony from woman one of whom be by some guy in his who fid he get it when he or they use lot of emotion how they be of these men of testify in of this bill how order be how these woman need to be protect note order for then hold to determine whether the order would be extend to he whether she would be if the fid be revoke the time of this the of the fid she some long circumlocution in response then testimony the bill mike who look something like einstein get up the point order be issue on too little evidence judge like to issue order just to let thing cool off no who they think be right or the for order lightning session with little time to consider mcnutt speak with him few time during his testimony other pro-gunners get up to testify one he to file order to her out she counter by file one him he note this would the to his gun if the new bill one of the junior rep note this be we to be right respect this people who people go to hell i but we to be conviction with order point pro-gunner get up testify he do know his expire every driver license privilege not right like the right to keep third get up the problem with the justice system in of bill public he himself try to get bill joke respond he too public the then respond i you you get me the rope i tie the noose next public testimony on the simon rock bill testify she be the of lo he would be to shoot people inside build while he outside without his evil gun she the loophole should be close to prevent something like this from ever four or five other kid testify in of this bill one of spill for the good one of the student shoot by lo there of them t shirt on long one person buy gun in none of u support gun control the committee to grill or correct the kid except for who correct one student who could for fid only resident get fid he how much do you to bet this kid no he be con into testify for bill would cut completely off mcnutt speak this time note the bill write would both gun possess by note hunter in ct nh vt could be put for if they the somewhere in the wood get by underscore the lo could get fid resident student hell even ccw he no or record one junior rep upset it would resident longer to buy gun think it elitist we need the protection of prevent non-residents from buy without fid only two other in the union fid-type so comply with the of one home not enough one pro-gun reply this resemble mother her son in everyone out of step but johnny the college people be file out the pro-gun testimony for this bill thus only pro-gunners be when the other bill under the bill position be o four others notify police chief so they pull license when holder be convict strongly support o require trigger lock on sell oppose o require trigger lock on strongly oppose o every to their own gun oppose o fund bullet-proof vest for police support o for the support o on police discretion in the of fid oppose o non-resident license condition support o gun everywhere in the guess some of these take only second to consider the pro-gunners in unison either for or them mike note besides the in screw with trigger lock on gun bill would it for licensee to his unless it be lock blow right through when he we oppose it he bring up the record this would hundred of different license system the session since it the schedule it could not be until everyone who to testify it end cdt if you believe i for my or cdt write for my investor
