this project include distribute on post encryption see section on view on post below be go on with in this document to clunie dclunie helsingius julf for contribution here be the of i think post do help in focus our on the content of one sure lot of post or frivolous but in most these by user who find the novel once the novelty off they stop their wes i do mind see the those thing of our however the notion of provide shield for these repulse me if they such strong feel why they put their s on their post quite i with people who refuse to use their dclunie clunie seem to question the of but who they to risk should there be no question in this society we live in hold view lifestyle likely to result in public censure ridicule loss of employment or even give the heterogeneity of the jurisdiction from where the contributor to usenet post who know be be not some poster should up be count be one point of view but right do these to exercise such censorship from doug doug sewell why be it censorship to not expect someone to for themselves without the of this be best you tell me why you to require you tell me why the wish of of user of newsgroup should be when they do post user le right others they not usenet i would not honor rfd cfvs control or vote from one templeton i think of no by post site doe exist other the they do more net user who do know how to post the old more prone to do it from tom i not for others but i post in serious discussion pretty much worthless view hide behind the veil of worth the trouble of since i post to show support for principle of i be subject to more i ever receive before people seem to find it to insult someone whose they do know it to pretend there be no person behind the who feel the sting of comment doe hinder some method of control other poster people who seek such control will oppose it from of this free-er medium by poster to protect themselves with simply require poster be to discus their source of the for dribble this seem to be the thing currently do xtkmg gregory in there three go on by poster one job so to work le hour job so on from who do her current of work to know she think of look for work elsewhere the next from who be think of sometime soon doe coworkers friend etc etc to know it but who the third be sex this by people post in the but then it point out the post service might let more people doe seem to be suffer from the presence of poster in it seem to be help by it hoey hoey while there never be security or forge post on usenet the process until now be sufficiently inconvenient error-prone undocumented to limit it use by person who not the culture of the net on the other recent use of the post service on seem seem to be student help on homework problem it now be to for of dubious in his guide he his news post be break so he be use the service some the opinion of the people who hide behind veil of worthless people should own up to their think i with the point in world we would be sit in freely our opinion in effort to but in world nobody will you for your think or ridicule you but we live in world where the people who do with you try to you let it some people go to with your opinion no how you try to present it or how out it be this be since it doe restrict people from voice their opinion red e depew the consensus seem to be post service such seem sufficiently corrosive of the trust civility of the net this experiment should be end the next time the question come up we we try it we it doe more good we stop it from eichener post not problem from people like you who would post men up for they or puerile others bring up of i three question for you folk do people different thing to other upon whether their identity be or be know people so by other people the be most on forum itself on the freedom of it enjoy be there such thing freedom of from terry terry sigh just how service need will everybody run one soon the purpose who to benefit when there n service then then out there where this sudden with service come from for better or imho worse it look like gon get stick with these thing much i do like the of service like this become the norm i do think there much to be do since it obvious who to set one up with bite of work with freedom come responsibility responsibility be if it be enforce true responsibilty come with no coercion should post to group be wes i will be the first to i hold some opinion indeed i sure none of u completely orthodox in our opinion however i receive hundred of over the few fewer of them be post with good motif it get more more difficult to remember why we need the once lousing thing up for those who truly need the service or those who would put it to good use i not suggest we should server i there in which be good thing tm however the notion shield should be extend to every usenet discussion be ridiculous it open the door to further twpierce tim pierce of course how doe one determine whether group request the service of poster vote in positive of vote or no one for newsgroup i not convince by the post service for newsgroups be inherently simply it diversion from the quo since the quo previously permit post to no newsgroups post service would reject the quo m write it be to suggest newsgroup be best to decide whether it to post of them force upon them by service ogil w ogilvie the service provide for to the poster since most usenet do know john smith from doe except by their opinion their the effect of post to which reply be direct be except for those who know the poster the of could be serious like this be to but the benefit well the cost must be weigh limit the service to group or specific group would not help those who on sensitive issue in more newsgroups from point be some of u find in to be profoundly offensive in different forum different if i get phone from someone who wo identify himself i up if i get with no return it go into the unopened if someone me in the street while i expect violence in discussion the be will to himself with the be discuss which discredit his listen to them of time to fun psych experiment the be fill with the thing people will do they wo otherwise include one notorious study involve torture would not fun stuff in fine u out of it from jbuck joe buck you obviously never submit to referee where you will receive review through server the editor much like the one in you reply the editor will the your of someone who to express on issue with person who you on street with ski be just overwrought nonsense such poster pose no to you jik j it seem obvious to me the should be not to post in newsgroup the usenet on the principle the quo should be keep unless there number of people who to it if someone need to post in newsgroup in which this be do they find someone on the net to do this for them they do need service to do it the service be by it of the judgment to decide whether post need to be from twpierce tim pierce for newsgroup you i bet i envision involve need for secrecy if filter of post could be devise to screen out those do require secrecy wonderful but it be do from lhp petersen if newsgroup to be noise then it should for this should on per-newsgroup not usenet on post of course one principle of might be to keep out post could be it would still be i would prefer be on content clunie dclunie if group doe to receive post it should become there define on group for this to exclude post from eg site or could be if to such then they welcome to do so good luck to them i doubt if i will be their group from possible need would someone for post to sci group sure most will to post under their own why would they to hide behind post service of they to or just try to rile people without of be identify post their in group if i or else need to tell you those group then you be on exotic for too long from it bloody the proponent of unimpeded post seem to find middle grind why be there such perception of where doe this syndrome come from i i it now who the control here from remember this be newsgroup for poster write scientific issue discussion of scientific issue to science from noring jon noring though poster their not be compel enough to convince me omni-newsgroup post should be or severely restrict though i not prove it it seem to me those who do not like post in principle do so for discomfort for to the integrity of usenet remember it be impossible to be to the motif for post to newsgroups one would not deem to be sensitive in i even let newsgroup vote on either or not post since priori they not know the motif of poster i do not believe system should ever be institute would inhibit the post of post lyle j write i do believe pseudonymous post in serious discussion if there be for the poster identity but simply they not so sure if they their doe in my book oh if you come up with purpose for post enlighten me sderby p derby three of our the found seem to think post ok the be print in new york with to publius i wonder if you would find their purpose should system do with post from emcguire ed mcguire i would like to know how to junk post by the service currently be discuss i would tell my fee site not to fee me post by the service the c news be simple to this or where should i look to how to do it myself from dclunie clunie bite be it your user decide they would like you to do this or you decide for them from emcguire ed mcguire good question nobody decide i no definite to do this just the be i to be in the position of offer such service my promise of protection of would be limit not on the of opinion of get post but on the of post which disrupt the smooth of the usenet the most obvious direct recourse would be to out the le possibility exist the support fire extinguisher by which be prevent from post john john since when be usenet if someone to run service their business if you to put host in your killfile your business if to post from site between them the other people site if everyone ignore service the service effectively doe exist from jik i nntp server post from not service to the net they do the net disservice server the problem open nntp server they people who to do thing on the internet to do so without there by now public site over this country if not over the world very inexpensive to the usenet the internet there be no for nntp server to to post through them there be no for server to to connect to them then outbound connection through them when it to get to the internet or the usenet open server could be justify but not now jurgen i think these point show be post service of responsibility both it client the net whole such service should imho set of well-defined rule it client should sign under the term of which they from be the problem some use to punish poster who upset in some by to the or the poster belong to surely be the most gutless to solve problem but my experience on the net show the user who vilify post the first to write obsessively to the poster supervisor when his or her be disturb by some intrusive or subversive post or post prevent just this kind of from eric schilling the point i would like to here be while we go through revise the news sw to reject post to newsgroups or some such thing i think the will prove futile to modify news result in by service provider to the i think this would be pointless from julf helsingius i try to out of this discussion see where the discussion but now i feel like i to up i i do block user if they continue their be in the user heed of the stop in some even in public when the not the desire effect i block number of user i block to group where the vote to post i feel the newsgroup to be the only solution for newsgroups to discussion red e depew doe this you volunteer to issue request for discussion to post or to of the newsgroups your server i do think so but this the trouble your server be listen to the consensus of the news in this group newsgroup should be consult before let your server post to group from eichener there be no pompous consensus of the news here you would like to invent one there be number of people who concern the possible to minor extent the of the server it be configure now these concern be with them there some few who with before their mouth condemn the service number who defend it point out like gregory even group like benefit from pseudonymous post from julf helsingius i lot of to server result of block number of user i the service from newsgroups where the user vote on the issue i not comment on the newly-implemented emergency security hole keep me busy user query the two week i feel it be not for me to justify the service but for the user the problem with be the be elective represent people whith strong interest in control from m this seem to be bigoted i would consider this group be for who wish to discus how the net should be control we only interest in control be of you perfectly welcome to join in the discussion here to promote your view on control jbuck this whole be lot of sound fury signify nothing even if you decide to post server it be not the only people who could enforce retrictions those control the link policy should be by not by to you need to those who run the service to like this through friendly not by try to them over the with stick stick you do even spp steve pope i find this pseudonymity bore our friend post through penet point the old would like to keep their network the it be this new thing these pseudonymous server cut into their turf so they whine bitch it every time there the slightest such somebody sig be too long they try to into pseudonymity i go on record three cheer for the server like penet for the service provider who will to preserve their client pox on those who try to restrict pseudonymity mimir bill i would help people get rid of post group if you do like someone then you put in your kill file not of them of course if when i get site go i just go to like jsmith of to most of the you never know it be will you from bennett i must to some this i see the of post under some yet believe strongly these should be identify such so people who do not wish to from people who wo identify themselves do to i to see good you would be indeed surmise you will people inconvenience by hide the of post from your site would you to justify where the hell you get the to try to prevent people from effectively filter their news they see fit from dclunie clunie i think i out of here in too one of the u site involve in the fee to the network through whom my site be connect not in just the concept of no redeem consume link with which i stop the service or disconnection i consider the demise of my service to be i wish the finnish luck it be pity there very few if service provide with in the u i guess the benefit of constitution one freedom of speech system conspire to subvert it in the of the public good be go on with run by j helsingius from funny how the rest of the usenet over the with stick be ok if it but somehow people on the other side of the not even to shut it off entirely but just to some control to the themselves to do i write to time in the couple of week he use to reply to me quite i the source of the deliver to him he use to be downright prompt reply to me funny now he be impolite who doe even when it consist of very civil query from julf helsingius in your you tell me you send me one or more on feb feb the server down the flood of result from the server come up my own host the problem by user send of to user fill up user the bounce end up in my overflow my disk well i only suppose your get lose in i try to much possible of the i get from routine to the service on the i spend hour per from why be it everybody else to put up with the impoliteness insensitivity of the misuse of whose definition of polite sense why why be consider to be within the of this concept of politeness in the first i think long since cross the line into be rude i tell him so in little while this point i deeply regret system support newsgroup b give the code to i do copyright it but i think some concept of politeness good sense might follow it to new home interest of politeness good sense seem to no interesection with mine i could even cope with if would be will to in control but somehow seem to be outside the of from julf helsingius there be no for me to convey how upset your me i do to some extent your feel but it still feel run the server require get use to lot of but mindlessly be so much to with something like this i do respect your view opinion to high degree no i not for i just you to know i give your view quite lot of weight when i for the i only go to provide the service to user but lot of people request i keep the service open to the community i now i ought to you point to how you feel me use your stuff in such context i to i will the few piece of code thet still stem from your system there be no to remove the structure i get from you i sorry the result of your work end up be use in you do of i will be give lot of think to the possibility of shut down the server from i think i feel rude impolite if it good for it good for me he do the usenet whether good he just do it yes i seriously rude in the now i think i the usenet slightly modify not for whole-site but just destruction only outside too let to this line people be do thing like the udp be others post for no one could ever stop them it only politeness good sense prevent them up to now in i people who express the desire to the udp p no in there not to the udp it would be to know how people gulp when they though i do see it different from pps now i some by the p there to the udp they for my code i send it yet only one site would be to bring to screech implement the udp on their own if they to politeness good sense prevent them from do so i wonder how long before one form of impoliteness bring on form from julf helsingius it would be to bring to screech in it couple of time but we here let me one well very simple one if somebody us something like the udp or bring down by some other it will down but i will let the user know why the person who do it ok somebody on this you to responsibility for your right from v i very of this service courtesey of some question my be resolve due to kind help of other people who be thru in return i reply to post where i think i could positive contribution in service be in my opinion like tool some people will not use it responsibly i suggest it should be keep be le life i think from j collins i be inform the post service to newsgroups be turn off result of discussion in this newsgroup over people it i be post to misc newsgroup topic for which i
