from crypt-comments subject cryptology for cryptology this be the fourth of ten of the the mostly independent but you should the first before the rest we do the time to send out miss by so do note such refer to the reference list in the the section of this ftp to xx the be post to the newsgroups every content in term be cryptosystem be the of this why be the one-time secure ciphertext-only in term you brute-force key-guessing entropy in term be cryptosystem cryptosystem consist of encryption system e decryption system d the encryption system e be collection of function index by key k some set of p to some set of ciphertexts c the decryption system d be collection of function such p p for every p be succesful decryption of ciphertext into be use the key index use for the correspond encryption of into ciphertext such system wherein the key be use to encrypt decrypt know symmetric cryptoystems be in intuitive term on cryptosystem be method of with some their correspond ciphertexts under some unknown key figure out more the it possible to this here we go fix function f g h of n fix encryption system e fix distribution of key on e use g f give h with p be with f g of input one output h such there be p of compute h h if we f f g g note this depend on the distribution of the vector k the be or pointless if there be p of compute h h if f f g g here uniformly over the possible ciphertexts no to in other word be if it doe use the encryption be one-ciphertext if n two-ciphertext if n so on the of this in cryptology you never prove cryptosystem be secure we keep strong cryptosystem must this property but this property be no cryptosystem be strong in the purpose of cryptology be to precisely if possible prove the cryptosystem be strong we for cryptosystem be secure if the system define be too slow to be if we prove this then we confidence our cryptosystem will resist technique if we reduce this to some well-known unsolved problem then we still confidence the cryptosystem be to other of cryptology to definition the point be to explicitly identify we prove they produce the desire result we figure out it for cryptosystem to be use properly it just the the methodology be useful for too the of incorrect often he try to construct proof of security for system see where the proof use these the point for his why be the one-time secure by definition the one-time be cryptosystem where the ciphertexts key string byte string of some length m p be just the sum let the exclusive or of k p it be to prove there no single-ciphertext on the one-time uniform distribution of key note we do to uniform distribution of here the proof let be two input f g produce one output h with some p h h p whenever f f p g g p g g k p then the distribution of k be uniform independent of p the distribution of k p must be uniform independent of p but the distribution of c be uniform independent of p hence there be p h h p whenever f f p g g c over p c thus fortiori be on the other the one-time be not secure if key k be use for more one there multiple-ciphertext so to be properly use key k must be throw one encryption the key be this the one-time ciphertext-only in the ciphertext-only be one where f be give only some g n ciphertexts the to some of produce some h the the be if it just good of produce h when give g for for g c c h p be the first bite of p we write down the guess which simply guess h p be this be it doe use the ciphertext it fifty-fifty of guess correctly no on the other there be on which produce one bite of p with success use c if it be feed c then the success drop to so this be the f g h depend only on in other word give two ciphertexts one decryption the should produce the other decryption note often define in the produce the key but this be pointless the the key only it let him decrypt further be the first of series of on cryptosystem where the fee to the encryptor these do fit into our model of let the choose look the correspond ciphertext then until he figure out how to decrypt more of this sort of the chosen-key chosen-system much more form of be corruption where the try to the ciphertext in such to useful in the there to throw kink into of these for encrypt p t h r p where t be time-key sequence number choose for r be number h be function here plus exclusive-or in term you brute-force consider the follow we give some p ciphertexts c we give ciphertext we run through every key k when we find k such for every i n we print if n be big enough only one key work this will succeed on input the time while it will produce correct result only once in blue moon for input thus this be it only problem be it be very slow if there possible key key-guessing entropy somebody be use the one-time but be choose key uniformly from m-bit he suppose to for our security proof in he know to prefer key which english word then run through english word possible key this will often succeed it much brute-force of the entire we how key distribution be by it entropy this number e be the number of bite of of the key will the key within guess e be define the sum of where be the of key k
