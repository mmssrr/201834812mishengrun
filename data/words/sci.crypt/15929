from smb steven bellovin subject re clipper consider in john kelsey write the clipper chip user key be form by e d e e d e e d e why be the triple-encrytion use be it just to effective in to if so why use bite key not know the it not possible to guess whether this it or to guess why form they it would be to see the to look for of it require three ciphertext block form in odd where do the with the number to form come from they from chip to chip or session to session even if they publish in the ny time if be to when use triple encryption then there no in security but why kind of weird if those three bite then it use to ensure on if it exist be use to derive for whole production run of these chip i our question in but i them the form the compute be of course the triple encryption suggest for use with de it much stronger single encryption effective key length of bite for be discuss when de first simple double encryption would not the strength triple encryption be use by ibm since more or le the begin to encrypt other key it recommend for of very high i think we the fit description why well you need different i no if they be disclose or not guess they construct so they differ in bite position possible goo cryptosystem will thing lot with even but the of n in series will bite there might be so the i guess choose to the in event i quite convince one not go to the from the let u observe if the u they do need to find but even if they do they get in theory they should never even see those even with the question i think be why use this scheme oppose to number my be this be much more look suppose nist the the eff the combine to build good number it every test you could think of when you come next week to some more chip doe it still work well component in the component be out from under you doe it still work well the in the presence of focus tend to it select bite yes you run test on it but consider on the other solution you bring your own floppy with you you run checksum etc it lot to verify the be in other word yes i think of to too i think they lot there three issue with clipper the first be whether or not the of the whole scheme be of work my with one exception be yes i do think nist design this scheme well be their objective to permit under with minimum risk of the exception be u exist outside of the chip on diskette seriously wrong should be onto the chip to those who i do my be obvious though i find my own sufficiently i force to rewrite the conclusion section of my i the scheme i issue this you be with implement such system with complete for civil right due process would you do differently in this question both strong outsider the to some domestic user be if you feel it to those do it in the context of the issue i present below right here i discuss just the no i do by just something be do it should be the second issue be whether or not this whole be go to be use just clipper chip this doe the only they be the will substitute it own chip between the the ship dock they bogus request so the escrow do wonder why they never sorry guy them terrorist drug pedophile seem to buy triple-des phone who thunk it i no to this question the moment i do see of it those concern of my in my to the question below the third most serious issue be whether or not clipper be good even if out strictly to the letter of the i think the be no but it not i civil not for i length on the net in the elder i do the energy to now but i will to some so long they respect the right of the government the in our system the right to issue while power be it be use quite properly in other be key escrow sufficiently different i think so but it not question for me it be for to of course since clipper be completely to much of the rest of their philosophy it for those who give their unreserved trust to government group i much more from steve bellovin
