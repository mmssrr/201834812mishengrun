from john kelsey subject one-time i think of couple of of in one-time encrytped scheme though i not sure how to prove kind of they provide obvious might be to prepend truly for eve block to the then crc which include the block of the this could be encrypt the the problem be i not sure it impossible to come up with will to the crc of the block it intuitively seem like it ought to be but i not sure crypto-strength like or the would be stronger but i not sure i it scheme to use up some of the bite to decide how bite of to include in the before go on would be too either the cost of the speed with which you use up your this could be use to give you low your opponent could spoof since decipher in spot should be will show something funny go on if for bite we use up one bite to decide whether to insert into the we get use of time the length we the by should in the doe be guess for our would-be spoofer bite she to guess i try to see how to her of it the through the spoof but it get little she get un synched still to in in the spoof now i see simple of do this get to be secure one-time cost of use time the length in bite for bite use one bite xor them together to get now encrypt the three bite with the one-time the enemy no of guess be so guess be either she in the ciphertext will to involve guess of be there to do this without use so bite spoof the be to correctly guess bite there bite in the this spoof just if you know the whole text if you know none of it in it look to me like this it just to spoof with the ciphertext without it but i not entirely sure be there of do this secure the one-time john kelsey
