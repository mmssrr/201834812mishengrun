from subject re more encrypt under k then k will be encrypt under the unit key uk the number of the unit to produce three which will then be encrypt under the system key sk produce e e m k e k uk number sk my be e m k be not encrypt under sk the key the decrypt key correspond to sk be hold by enforcement doe first knowledge on this i will check it out but this be so i do not to ok so there in two distinct component by the chip the encrypt with the key the number encrypt key encrypt with the imho kind of bogus the whole concept of one key million of people use which be doe seem key suppose i the output of this chip i to determine which bite the encrypt which the number session key suppose i design simple on this which the the encrypt session key twiddle bite or before it send down the line mind you i sure the think of this with other i the system be somehow design so of this will receive chip to somehow to decrypt successfully but how if the two in on some kind of consistent bit-twiddling scheme so the decryption chip see the restore proper but get e k uk wrong i suppose this could be if the chip send out time in slightly different it effectively impossible to be you know the be send mime ripem if your theory predict different outcome depend on whether you use discrete or continuous then you get the wrong theory bruce
