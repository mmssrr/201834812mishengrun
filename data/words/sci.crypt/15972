from finney subject re steve-b steve brinich write second question why why be such procedure use not rng this turn those in kind of bottleneck for system security the only theory sense be either the for chip or very few possibility so try to the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible number one billion multiply by the number of different my of denning description be choose by of the key escrow the of chip session i the chip in which will them to be quickly there would not be need to chip one time into little some people envision my guess to why this procedure be use be the key on the use specify provide in-principle to verify no door exist in the choice of the number use to the key since we to trust the escrow it doe not the system to the key be from seed enter by the escrow since the for be public modulo secrecy then in principle could the procedure for to be expose run his own independent of to verify be be be put onto the floppy yes there in which to follow this scheme could be to check the will not be destroy time hide in the ceiling could see the enter by the trust escrow door in the chip could u to be recover heck chip could be record with the u ignore on the floppy finney
