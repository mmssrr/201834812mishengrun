from myrto subject re once your code be no good more in templeton write in timothy c write get the court order to the key which be on or disk or i the i could be wrong but i see no mention of session key be the escrowed entity true in theory in the technology of phone will be spectrum quite difficult to record the crypttext without the key if the frequency depend on they key i it to it could be effectively impossible to record i not expert in the science but some thing seem evident to me thing which this clinton clipper do not the to opportunites for conclusion on i see the membership of this group except for two person to if be possible by the government in theory it end up in so the key be to impossible question remember power doe corrupt i think one to this whole in the sense it will be to include other form such store such should be if it be or such will be impossible to stop use clipper precident there hint of in the remember with me i not very so i more word to others could much more briefly you once it hit you record it if you telco the telco be suppose to give without the rule i suggest this be now the hint be in the this or be consider for other form of encryption such file such dependent on how this thing be or fly i think one would be wise to this in the one would when not if it get to other phone i think this be to if this get by politics it be be use in other it be to be use here government be not go to give up on the they should be to whenever they to order require prove to be flimsy if the they the force one to give the key or sit in forever on renew contempt so it be not deny the justice system the nor the to lock someone up if guilty or refuse to divulge the to the info this be not protect under the fifth one be force to perform would result in divulge evidence so block restriction on encryption be not prevent enforcement it doe enforcement bunch more difficult fish expedition without the knowlege do give up the right to be from should be clinton co know it which be why they quietly develop this thing figure if they get it this they it on through how come those consult could be roughly describe u insider they not quietely impliment it though when they other scheme to ensure it exclusive use hence the nice pr document to try everyone do buy into it government kind of trust or future to be secure free one must keep government honest the only to do be to impossible not or but even so the evidence would not be i think unless the judge so order i think even interception of the crypttext without would be cop record then judge hey we permission to listen to those they so one could use by re-use of the key the finish or other key break to find other evidence which give to judge would which would be possible otherwise this be the more common of of in the for cop this might be to keep them honest but the feed somehow bet on it doe believe for the government will use scheme not listen in on for keywords either in or key i sure do this whole thing sound like something to the need to use police work to build in the with or without court order i think the enforcement community become bite spoil will resist require them to revert to use detective work i just find it surprise come from bunch so much civil right put people first the question be put people first to where with the not be how be one to be sure there doe exist key for use by etc so they do their keyword etc on they routinely monitor without specific court order remember the phone be only bet on it so i not police tell people they be nothing find be to keep them from simply keep the key on file for time they would quite collection keep for folk they deem if they get only one key would reduce the lot unless it be scheme remember nixon need for court order slow them down do it unless the escrow not government control i see one end up be under the other under justice it could be worth some serious buck to some folk to get key to competitor clinton clipper or descendent when this be to be use for non-government encryption enough buck would get one the key or the for this not concern but give government the other problem worse of course if the government then us this clinton clipper to for restriction on encryption this be the concern of most of u i think the nose in the tent etc yes be concern but i think they think they win just by of the use this system they do even to the leave they do the crook john gotti who would to be not to he likely to be glibly on his phone murder why he in now to believe but true will one do when it be to encryption you bet if clipper be will be next on the it be even hint in the it expect the well if you get nothing to hide fine then use one should not object to video be in every room of one home exteme of the but the principle hold stuff should even from govt fish expedition in the future to when it come to the feed government pretty if they to something do work so to give up some right or precidents the price could be hell to this scheme succeed without forbid more which people would fight lot they like this enough they drop the so telephony to rumour however the of be complex since they still to get the crypttext on telco system require bite of work people would fight forbid more now but in two we this which must be by some just this restriction will only bother those who someting to hide etc do buy into it if the clinton clipper be so very good why not it public so people it few expert respect by whom for professor who like key would be one of the select expert this doe seem to on some the person if i how would know the expert be the will end up be use in the clipper chip if it be keep secret the clipper will use cripple version with key provision or not present in the version subject for study by the expert who choose the expertes the government no conflict of interest there be it requirement for decent encryption scheme it not it effectiveness reduce by the widely know i to believe one should the other side everything you except for the key s i present to this group reject if requirement exist the be secret question since it be bet this clipper thing would not be use for government security they it not secure but good enough for common folk i think i would like to see full description not pr of just good enough i think when how strong it be good enough not very the excuse other country these restriction be not other country do not our bill of right constitution which the people not the government of those other country often with envy we right they privilege if we expect to those right protection we must not them to be gutted we just get this thing to crime we our bill of right pretty much tear to shred we should not permit more for yet we should be try to the our crime problem number of but too right be not one break court system poor police work much more too right the root for crime etc btw those who suggest this be just on clinton believe this i would be go who seriously propose this thing it be just step in erosion of our right under the constitution or bill of right the couple of be non-stop series of end-runs the protection of the constitution it to stop now be good time if it be too templeton corp without prejudice ucc myrto if else try uunet pilchuck rwing wisdom only two thing infinite the universe stupidity i not sure the former einstien
