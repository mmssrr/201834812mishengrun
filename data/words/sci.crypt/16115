from subject re in ds i suggest propose cipher system le entropy the user key embed big the difference in entropy between the entropy of the user input the entropy of the output for de the unsuspecting user input string to be encipher he the which be by george quisling come out with nine in nine out right the unsepecting user ship the ciphertext to be decrpyted the be produce everything fine right nope the do compression on before desing compress be down to four with more entropy wj the opponent now the with his own compress before de to the compress when decrpyted the first compress be strip off send unbeknowst to the receiver the opponent collect the in the bite bucket uncompress to kill now to prevent such or covert you would need to entropy the time which be priori impossible for might be by one bite in the output reserve the rest of the output bite for the long covert in other word if you opponent get to muck with the you either get to muck with it or concede his possible embed of covert in other word if you present to opponet with le entropy then you give him free bite of fc
