from subject ripem frequently question sun this post this be still rough list of likely question ripem for public key encryption it this not ripem write will be by it will be post to of newsgroups on monthly follow-up discussion specific to ripem be redirect to the group this month i this post in to comply with the for hypertext to of this document over the world wide web let me know you think nothing in this should be consider or other one person opinion if you to question be ripem ripem be which perform pem use the technique of de it your electronic to the property of who send it be confirm nobody it except the intend recipient ripem write by mrr most of the code be in the public except for the routine which license from security inc how i get ripem ripem the of routine which be consider munition thus be export-restricted from distribution to people who not or resident of the or therefore the follow request be quote from the file do not export the code in this distribution outside of the or this be request from me the of ripem condition of your use of ripem note be not in the public license for it be include with the distribution you should it before use ripem the best to get it be to friend for copy since this will reduce the on those site do it not to mention the run them this require you trust the friend ripem be ftp to resident in the from cd to the file for info i look this site only the source tree doe not compile or the nice version ripem well some other crypt stuff it home site on which be open to ftp for user in the who or resident to find out how to ftp there cd to the file for convenience for here in to the full source tree will ripem run on my it be port to ms-dos most of unix sunos next linux ultrix etc port to include unix-style port nice port write by of stuffit more port expect help of user be invite will ripem work with my how the effective be will depend on the of the though the user guide include with the distribution discus to use ripem with include berkeley mush elm mh code be include in elisp to use of ripem inside gnu if you new for ripem or improvement on one in the distribution which you believe be convenient to use secure be useful to others feel free to post it to be be crypto system which be or public-key this there two different key one to encrypt one to decrypt one not be derive from the other you publish your encryption or public key widely keep your decryption or key to yourself use your public key to encrypt but only you hold the key need to decrypt it note the send with be just the de key to the see be de note the only provide for for the fingerprint of the see be fingerprint like be encrypt with the sender key the recipient use the sender public key to decrypt it confirm the must come from the sender for the three men rivest who invent it to find out more ftp to look in or look in be de de be the encryption widely use symmetric or secret-key crypto system unlike de us the key to encrypt decrypt however de be much ripem us both de it key encrypt your with de use key it then encrypt key with the recipient public key include the result in the letter the recipient to recover the de key de be sometimes consider it be old us key length consider too short by modern however it should be opponent or government it be not unlikely future ripems will strengthen the symmetric cipher possibly by use multiple encryption with de be pem how doe ripem pem be system for of encrypt electronic it be describe in rfcs these document be obsolete the old rfcs ripem be not complete of pem pem specify for key which ripem doe not this time their be this distribute key for remote user to be to send secure to you she must know your public key for you to be to confirm the receive from her you must know her public key it be this be if guy convince her his key be in yours she will send which he ripem for three method of key server the distribute finger server file three describe in the ripem user guide which be of the distribution none of them provide perfect security why do ripem public key look very ripem public key begin with pkcs identifier describe the key so the first bunch of in your key be the those of lot of other people key this doe not your key but only they the of key be with the of the length etc be fingerprint like be digest produce by security inc it provide fingerprint or secure of the it be secure it be not possible in of to produce different which produce the fingerprint thus of sign the entire with the sender key only the of the need to be sign for be sometimes use for other purpose for it be often use to input of length to bite of interpreter or cookie be describe in it entirety include in c in rfc be pgp pgp be pretty good pgp be longer ripem work differently pgp be not with ripem in though pgp doe use some difference between pgp ripem pgp more key for user without direct network connection ripem conform to the pem rfcs thus of work with other pem pgp no to be with other pgp in pgp be not with pgp ripem us of routine from security inc come with license which use pgp us it own of which be not license thus pkp the firm hold the on the it be infringement of to use or sell pgp in the or in of this pgp phil in the in if you live in the you not you should run pgp on your computer public key to forbid you from run my pgp be both pgp ripem export-restricted not be send outside the however pgp exist on ftp site in europe other whether you use pgp or ripem or the to pgp be recommend to interest in such issue note the both export restriction people think it should be some people interpret document differently discussion of it on the net seem to produce more light belong in see rpem rpem for it to ripem but use public-key cipher invent by which be not in to the on it write by the ripem it distribution when to the belief of include public key pkp their enough to cover public-key cipher whose strength rest in the difficulty of product of prime not just this be not by but not for rpem be not use it be not with ripem or pgp be mime mime for multipurpose internet extension be describe in rfc you find out it in the newsgroup how pem should with mime be not yet entirely some people use the solution of mime type in order to send ripem mime one i hope some will emerge internet document exist on the i this simple to the security of ripem you wish to check the post which discus some of the more obvious on ripem security procedure will the risk ripem be key distribution
