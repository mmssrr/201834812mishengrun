from kempmp petri pihko subject re concern god long this kind of cry for comment jbrown write in scott compton write jim you write god do not nor be he responsible for the of newborn god do life to protein code which be evolve without delve into deep discussion of v evolutionism god the genetic code perfect without do you evidence for this if the code once perfect ever since we should some evidence in of this should we the biggest imperfection of the code be it be full of non-coding region intron which so they intervene with the cod region exon impressive of evidence suggest intron of very origin it be likely exon represent protein be the number of intron or it intron loss occur specie with common quite exon-intron structure in their gene on the other the possibility intron be insert present difficulty intron remove by splice this would to be present but unused if intron insert moreover intron insertion would require precise insertion would not be since sequence for intron self-splicing of conserve besides of sequence long site these not find in or intron sequence i seriously recommend textbook on biology genetics before post like this try biology of the gene or lodish biology of the cell for remember the question pose in context why doe god in newborn my be likewise from perspective my own it be no le purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective be support by the evidence perspective often to fulfil this criterion i think you my i god the genetic code perfect but doe it perfect now it evolve since for the worse would you cite few reference support your your be le the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in it be more we think for sex might evolve defence this view be support by computer of evolution eg i think it higher energy like cosmic most of the in it be energy doe most of the it be mild fix by neither of u know the like the time when god life to my recollection most biologist do not life billion would only be billion or so the it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember figure more like to billion for the of life on with better i with form since there be no need to invoke if the be form without one most recent of the of the between billion sign of life not true fossil but to billion this would more billion for the first cell to evolve i sorry i give reference this be on the course on biochemistry i here dominion it no for to engineer both genetic the force of selection tend to improve the of specie the of the genetic code tend to more offset this do you this be true or do you evidence for this suppose i scott excuse me but this be so i know you must be jest do you know do you know point do you know everything come in response to your no neither do you you very well believe it but you not know i hope you do forget this we evidence suggest everything come do you evidence this conclusion in science one doe not to believe in it be sign to doubt disbelieve but the right to be to look the evidence if you do so not to present one own conclusion prior to this theology doe not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusion be more complex tend to error our well-being to fight off while the simpler of virus tend to become more efficient in infection it be hence we newborn suffer from genetic you suppose purpose not move virus do not exist to they just of principle of evolution only from we just efficient method for our to survive the le efficient method do it to the present for the time present some evidence for your be through process some people the opposite be true we suppress our selection thus bind to i see much evidence for either but then i so where be this to my discussion in john question of why why there genetic why there so which require to develop be it god the question i no it be not of course nothing evil be god but your doe not work it you be right but the be you do know be not responsible neither do i suppose powerful evil be like exist would it be he might be responsible for of the ill i do think so he could do much better job pun intend the problem be it seem no be to they just product of evolution do i where seem to me like inference you do be to oversimplify i to the point your of my word on new context i never people by god to be punish by get why i do be free choice consequence if choose to reject god people do since the begin then they should not expect god to protect them from event in entropic universe i not expect this if god exist i expect him to u i would like to why do you believe your choice indeed free this be interest question the be not it seem to be consequence would you expect from reject oh i it not perfect yet but i work on it good or bookstore be good point doe this to do with the price of in or the question to which i provide biology genetics fine subject scientific but they how god set up life process they do the why behind life or it subsequent evolution why be there why behind your proposition something be not support by the evidence this be why we recommend these book be there need to invoke why behind prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe come into existence without intervention recent theory et suggest why do people still insist on this scotty for your fine but i not highly to the nitty-gritty of biology genetics i sure i find it subject for i the do not the big picture god life in the begin with the to to it environment i sorry but they do there be no evidence for your big picture no need to be of it come into existence without supreme be try revisit petri petri pihko kem-pmp be the truth c physic be the rule of oulu kempmp the chemistry be the
