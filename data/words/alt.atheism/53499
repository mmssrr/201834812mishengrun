from kempmp petri pihko subject re consciousness ii kev strike kevin write my reply it society be on the verge of usenet be the best to ensure the voice of get through be it i i fight in this so i try to why i feel mind be kevin you now delve into field i know too little your i see it be very much the line of roger penrose who not be in his book the emperor new mind concern computer mind the of physic however penrose he insight or your only when we consciously look could be just illusion we obviouslu very different viewpoint i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from perspective it might not be but useful think of i write do you think worm mind or not they to experience they just like yet it be we might some in the future perform synthesis of c from the element would such worm mind firstly i not impress with the of they solve problem once the method be work out but not work out the method itself this be true to some extent however i do not think our work like computer in there be evidence work more or le enough for to evolve our work much like genetic i suppose the trick still to be there in some form to be discover doe this the we will ever into our this be unlikely give our encode in chromosome worth of genetic much of which be use indeed this be extremely unlikely give the of nurture on our mind i suggest however before try to our consciousness collection of kevin look the reference i mention think i still think the best expert on the of conscious mind neurologist neuropsychologists biologist but do not me for my opinion since they study be conscious the i my be this discussion not to if our too different do not bring qm into this discussion not physicist with the our consciousness some role in physic i would it doe the other problem with be their not survive if you out portion of their code yet people survive stroke without go completely there side-effects but still seem neuron in perfectly people die survive if i corrupt bite of it code not computer do forget this this doe not they need something else to work they just work differently their be perception of high intelligence the next problem be the sticky question of be colour with the of your choice the viewpoint be it the product of some kind of the product of such energy different be colour mixture of these you still expect we could find the of in our somewhere in the form of some this be not how i see it the be time-dependent in the of our cortex it be distribute with the help of to the rest of the indeed fire i sometimes think of our consciousness free induction of these fire but this be just idle scientific september issue issue on mind you it from cover to cover there two on perception so you might be interest but note subjective experience not be observe from third-person perspective if we see nothing but we not go on to conclude this be not the mind write numerous where electric of different of lead to in the of mind for whose without his knowledge by remote control during interview quickly cure of his depression discuss to seduce his girlfriend in the lobe sometimes lead to when the flirt with the in conclusion there be evidence for subjective experience be to some sort of mind conscious process involve in of when we think of colour our cortex be etc consciousness be we become conscious of our with second our of our will by m thus i think it be fruitful to turn the question why do see colour be this seem to be observe since it seem our conscious mind be not the king of our if this be so computer wo see colour the chemistry be different doe see colour selective over doe it should the output of ought to be the in so why do we see colour this depend on be by colour doe network be of recognise number from to see the number if it be of sort them if you why doe who be conscious of itself observer over who doe i good my previous post where i write why sense of identity help to role more so they do unconsciously kill other with newly discover bite extreme but this be the when homo more more efficient in use tool sense of identity the concept of to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others conscious might be for such if i remember correctly consist of with two process on it the first process be evolution or be govern by schroedinger be well know the second process thing such of the or vector reduction or be more mysterious it be to occur when nobody seem to know precisely when occur when it doe occur the effect of r be to the if mind require for this doe this until mind to the scene never but in the superposition for my how powerful we this be discuss before i think this topic be since we do not mind neither do physicist i mind would be in x there seem to be some link between consciousness r in we never see superposition of there for this i no how be suppose to x but since this be only wo too much my point be there might be for mind in physic i but not in the sense you physic need mind to solve problem i go to my nice cell now if ok with you it ok if you do forget to with you the reference i write in my previous post plus the follow w psychology ed publish belmont c bring the in inquiry c w how in order to sense of the world science petri petri pihko kem-pmp be the truth c physic be the rule of oulu kempmp the chemistry be the
