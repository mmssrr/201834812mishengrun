from jbrown subject re gulf long in write jbrown write in write which news we western news in but in the cbs nbc etc the tone of the news during the whole one of those poor poor with look how precisely this cruise missile blow this build to bite most odd over here there very little the suffer of the until the end of the then it confine to the few true first the news seem by the new the use not to mention the video from the missile they in on their but the bunker full of hit they their tone it seem to me they do the for the of innocent people do die in it like they be only long it nice missile drop in on hq but not when picture of die crop up hypocrite how the innocent people who die in in i do you them discussion delete thing consider the fire-bombings the bomb be therefore justify in bring the to quick end to even loss i should here justify it seem from your comment below you understand this justify i the evidence know to surrender but before be lie peddle by the i often wonder this i think the first bomb should be drop on fortress of truk good the second bomb could be hold for use on center if need be but i digress yes i we find evidence the btw seriously consider surrender the first bomb the win out over the reject the u therefore the second bomb drop most imo i for one do regret it nuke for jesus i do regret the sometimes decision to be which the life of innocent people but i do regret the which those decision i regret the suffer by those decision why the fuss not timor or even tibet if be so why be we still sell them stuff couple of week before we bomb i no or effort to justify the misguide foreign policy of the west before the it be evident the west misjudge hussein but once hussein to corner portion of the world oil supply he to be stop oh i see so we overlook his use on of people but if he your right to drive huge well the get go it the both exist prompt u if some country take over some other country we would intervene not we do but we be the world or if coup occur in of then we still would there would not be the imminent perceive to but the of the two unprovoked by the to the west oil interest u to i move from here to on if we intervene hussein to keep then it would be right but do you ever such course of or you just set up i not set up if you to the then the only to hussein to keep include be ineffective i guess we should fight either just think of those innocent kill in dresden yes do too you know sure truly they follow hitler in his quest for reich the consequence stem from they be for it well in sense yes they no of end hitler would their to but those who do support hitler of conquest it not if they vote for his policy the get in the election of the the people get to vote on the they suffer with the rest why doe this bother you so much the world be full of evil not perfect innocent suffer due to the wrongful of others it it but there no perfect solution i look to your incisive comment timor tibet should i them in the people of timor still be kill by their country hell even western be kill this before the gulf why do we send in the bomber to timor why we send in the bomber now we not the of the world we police every country decide to self-destruct or nor we in position to get relief to tibet timor or some other here i move your intent to sound like love well you do very good job of it well it not very love to hussein or hitler to gobble up country keep them or to them to continue with of people under their dominion so i to yes stop hussein the most love thing to do for the most people involve once he set his mind on conquest the chinese government policy of of people round up torture execute recently report torture be still in why we stop them in why we suck up to them by freely with them tell me how we could stop them i support it i for one do not with the present u policy of suck up to them you put it i it be for poor poor rodney king do you ever stop think why the jury in the first bring verdict of not guilty yes the thing i think be hmm there lot of white people in jury so it the policeman on not rodney king erm surely it who on jury suppose to represent cross-section of the they or they suppose to reflect the of the where the be hold this be where the crime be commit unless one or the other convince the judge of venue be in order i not expert on or even u but it seem this be the the system be set up you the system but let not unfounded of prejudice throw under they deserve jury of their peer you people not the peer of white people no not the point be the there be no on the first jury rodney king be be this point of be this of people only be try before jury of people just like them be stupid should the nuremburg jury entirely up of peer doe those who do the thing like murderer judge murderer it people from the in life they in better position to the defendent s those who be the mouth for the blood of those policeman look no further the video but the jury look the evidence evidence which you i not see when i see bunch of policeman someone who lie defenceless on the grind it to this other evidence might be so it to so when from incredulity from the revere of construct we not we court of the point out some not view in court of ok however you use this of your in this discussion this be not court of if the the news present them true then i feel the not guilty verdict one be you not the of the the be not monolithic even though there be such the news hour try to give report of the news there even source out there if you know where to look for rush btw i never use the word i do without more evidence theory there be some to over news source thou not kill unless thou pretty good for kill in which thou kill kill who get in the it not be help jim brown bible for love i like the quote pretty funny i monty python you know kind of seem in vein of course oversimplify it seem but then you know only serious i kill innocent people you suppose it ok to kill innocent people so long you get some guilty one well i do it good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end be just we do live in perfect world there no perfect solution if one be go to resist then innocent people on both side go to suffer die i do it be ok it be but sometimes i bomb of city the end of world ii i see evil i would it evil in the sense it much suffer i not so sure it you conclusion only be by the involve it let we now know doe those who to the decision to bomb do see it be one full know of the consequence of before decision the time it seem enough to go with it but do i feel the bomb justify i do i just do condemn those who to difficult decision under difficult you criticise in the now i in no position to judge the of the end of the you not in such position if you i in position to judge but i defer judgment you the need to be in the context of the time they might be then but not now wrong they be neither then nor now they seem to those the decision to bring quick end to the i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision where your love where your oh how quick you to them when it suit you would jesus would puke one i will before jesus give of every word even this discourse in this forum i the full of i to do so i do believe you the btw the i bring up the in you be the be so yet bomb institute bomb enough to hit in decisive by other method time but in the gulf precision bomb the norm so the point why big stink the few result in spite of precision bomb when so more die under the bomb in even with precision bomb some suffer but le suffer in this other other in history go their life with interference from the the story of hundred of of be just bunk yes bunk the u lose serviceman in over four the of them be directly involve in fight but we expect to hundred of of die in month with the use the most precise bomb ever if hundred of of die it due to hussein take on his own people not due to the bomb jim b
