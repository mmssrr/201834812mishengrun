from simon simon subject re evolution now with free inside sorry the in respond due to conference in bob robert singleton write in simon simon write of delete i my ockums from my experience in physic for info in very interest i do know it before i follow your proof but i one question we two hypothesis h hg the be more which by definition p h p hg be in where p h p hg come from it more the other it from p h p hg p hg where g be the complement of g by p so p hg so p h p hg in sense hg be more h for h g so i be split but i try to be irrespective of subjective impression of how something be p h p hg hold with if only if p hg you point out it very simple to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x thus h be to be preferd to hg now to h be consistent with the hg be to p x h p x hg you some on this well p x p x b x be likely to be observe if be it be if b be this imply observe x doe not provide useful which might u to between the respective possibility b the difference reduce to the difference between the unknown unhelpful prior p p b p x p x b p x k p p b x k p b where k p x p x p x b p x so b consistent with the in observe x doe give pointer to which of or b be in the where h b hg however we know their prior order by p h p hg we do know the it this which u to deploy the to throw out such hg in the world it be cut dry it seem to me we determine whether the p x h p x hg be true true but the point here whether or not divine component underlie the of religion in to the memetic component which even the religious implicitly to be when they of the word now it seem to me i the observe in religious belief be well for by the memetic model but le well if one propose divine component in since i would expect the to conspire wide even exclusion belief thus my feel be p x hg be even to p x h in this but be h be memetic g be divine component x be the belief but i this be subjective impression btw my beef with your not one i check most of your work do find error you seem very so there be i think the be but just to sure i you it in term i think this be request i try to look for of physic to non-physicist i not nor type of so this would be very helpful not i such either but the be both theism with of the my to however theism of the type with which i concern suggest for be people be both in principle to intervene in this these region of the of possible which i loosely term of some under the theistic hypothesis under the since there be only so much for hypothesis to over the the which theism expend on of possible must come from somewhere else other possible else be this which of must slightly higher under under theism the stuff imply such must my run for the of the hypothesis to with correspond in my run for the of the theistic hypothesis sorry if still bite but it difficult to put it other since it doe depend on the property of density the under them be unity or not be helpful hypothesis be the coin be b be the coin be i use b to confusion with h t then p h p t p h b p t b the string of with no this be with both coin coin b however the expend by on possible the of even though they do must come from somewhere else since the must be unity it come in this from the of the of our run time e e b the x n time n be x n h the modify to p h e n e e m p h p h b e n b e b e b p h now we do know p h the prior of but the multiplier for e be for e b this be true every time the coin be toss be observe thus the of the n we n e n m e n e n b e b since e k e k b time k you show m thus hence the for the hypothesis must for the coin hypothesis b must even though both hypothesis with string of the loose be between coin between coin theism with consistent with both which would coin be to of which would i not the extend to the of the just the principle be the of no evidence for god if evidence for them be possible under the respective theism the they do exist it to distinction between theism could be support or not support by evidence theism give theism for which evidence be in principle not possible it doe sense to of evidence support the view quite so but this type of theism be i might the g in the hg in term of our discussion i bin it on those grind so it depend upon your conception of this god if it conception like who to come down to to quite frequently then i with you of evidence for this conception of god be evidence it doe not exist but if your conception of god be one doe not prediction see below on prediction then i of evidence doe not support disbelief the hypothesis do to be indeed in my model the theism be i use the should obverse give specific theism doe not the prediction p x ht why i use the word should theism no prediction specific event i only i believe god do such such such such or i believe god will do such such but for give i never priori p x ht i not even this for the set of or some this be do like your use of we no of these i hold science to positivistic if someone not tell me how to even in principle p x h then be not to hypothesis h such be the when h ht theistic for p x p x p be p how do i it you do to we do need in the to know prior to deduce the multiplier for the hypothesis be le unity the correspond multiplier for the coin hypothesis be unity you do need to know the of the run either it number of p p unity you need to know be whether p x be p x ht for observe x this follow from the there event render possible not under ht which not possible under else be rely upon series of but if the hypothesis be to even for to some not sequence of must be choose with i curious to know type of x x you in mind concern theism you like it doe nor the provide there some possible which would count of of this might be of the of or of the of but p x h for x still count prediction of h if the theism in question ht be or see my quote of god exist then this be prediction p x ht for such x it distinguish it from the hypothesis which predict this stuff doe not p x for such x theism doe not the p x ht for such x or i should my theism doe i too quick to we common you by the existence of god you the notion the deity describe by the bible by doe with the universe by those i with this however i must be here i believe this i not i should doe to there be shift of but since i only belief i not conclude p x ht for such x ok we doe to which would be better since doe imply which we both be i do think my theism prediction i not you by prediction could you you by this word i but in mind this be i require of theism be it not the prediction of will never doe before somebody point out doe this prediction either the difference be qm do not form prediction include such be imply if you do the you will find be or be not or verily i unto you this not till these thing be fulfil i do think we problem of here persistent of this stuff not consistent with ht though it be be more consistent with in the post even if ht god exist be no problem for my other you to let the number of go to infinity to it btw i do not consider require infinite number of or of the be not we exist never infinite number of conclusion reilies on this i do fine i do theism be merely the finite number of to me so suggest it be i continue to observe the suggestion look better better stuff delete in the post i theism indeed in finite number of here the quote the be there some which with the theist hypothesis not with the hypothesis thus would these i of but this need not be too which require for it one or more god exist will count other to be with both hypothesis this theism in single only by such of here be my problem with this for something to be it must the prediction should not be see if be see then the hypothesis be now be word in oposition to something theism theism belief disbelief so there just there theism if my theism the world be only old god doe not decieve then this be however the be in oposition to theism be i could be wrong on this contd i think you of be sufficient to in the correspond theism be i think more it until then here be question suppse x be be not x no by of let x the coin be or more so not x sense the two side of the coin different this be by toss the coin even string of be consistent with coin you to go to infinite number of toss to x in the limit it converse be be when one one this be wrong with you which require x x n to be there simply no such truth in to the god exist now by use of your symmetry i why someone would since the doe not exist no prediction i will choose not to believe it but none the le this would be found on type of or if you do like the word insert belief for which there be no evidence i you god exist up there the highlight but by our definition of exist the prediction i it be in finite number of i doe not exist no prediction oops sorry the truth of this depend upon which god you refer to but i think of some conception of god for which it be true but once i open to the posibility i could be wrong so give me some of prediction of the god doe not exist here be one i think of if true then there would be no or miricles but this in principle never be determine one or the other there in which people seem to recover without the help of doctor for no know these do in they consistent with theistic hypothesis but in no support such hypothesis we here they not inconsistent with hypothesis i think of one prediction from doe not exist be of this type but i might be miss something the will not on october would to my it it to doe not of course theism other those which predict it no phenomenon which require the existence of one or more god for it will ever be observe sum the whole thing up bob singleton bob cheer simon simon simon of computer science tel university of coventry
