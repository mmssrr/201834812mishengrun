from subject introduction to introduction version begin pgp sign introduction to by this to provide introduction to whilst i try to be possible contentious issue you should remember this document represent only one viewpoint i would you to widely your own conclusion some book list in to provide sense of cohesion progression i present this between theist the question by the theist question which be crop up on since the newsgroup some other frequently question in note this be question pose from viewpoint this be the file reflect question which be it be who on so when i of religion i religion such which involve some sort of divine be much of the discussion will to other religion but some of it not be be by of belief in the existence of god some go further believe god doe not exist the former be often refer to the position the strong it be to note the difference between these two position be simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong be positive belief god doe not exist do not into the of strong some believe in the non-existence of god others limit their to specific god such the god but be disbelieve in god the thing believe he doe exist definitely not disbelief in proposition one doe not believe it to be true not believe something be true be not to believe it be one simply no whether it be true or not which bring u to be then the term coin by professor huxley meet of the society in he define someone who strong believe the origin of thing must be some unknown thus be someone who belief we do not not know for sure whether god exist word slippery thing be of you work out someone point of view simply from the she herself or for people use to use the word only when refer to strong the word so of it be very difficult to you for sure be do believe in god for it be the believe science be the best to find out the universe so be the or for there for to find out why person choose to be it best to her feel the of god present by the religion be it be impossible such god could exist others through scepticism they see no evidence god exist but be it impossible to prove the non-existence of something there to such for it be quite simple to prove there doe not exist prime number other prime number of course this with well-defined object obey well-defined rule whether god or universe well-defined be for however for the moment the existence of god be not impossible there still subtle for the non-existence of god if we something doe not exist it be possible to show this be by find single if on the other we something doe exist if the thing in question be not impossible show the be require of possible where such thing might be find to show it be there such be often or impossible there be no such problem with prime we prove they do exist therefore it be we must thing do not exist unless we evidence they do even theist follow this rule most of the time they do believe in unicorn even though they conclusively prove no unicorn exist to god exist be to which not be test we not of everywhere god might be to prove he doe exist so the by god doe not exist since be we test those who profess strong do not no sort of god exist they restrict their so to cover of god describe by follower of religion so whilst it be impossible to prove conclusively no god exist it be possible to prove god describe by religious book doe not exist it even be possible to prove no god describe by religion exist in believe no god describe by religion exist be very close to believe no god exist however it be sufficiently different on the impossibility of disprove every kind of god not but if god be if god with our universe in the effect of his must be hence his with our universe must be if god be it must therefore be the he doe not with our universe in would if god doe not with our universe it be of no whether he exist or not if the bible be to be believe god by the surely he should still be note i not god in it must surely be possible to perceive some effect by his presence though otherwise how i distinguish him from the other thing do exist ok you think there for but be it still religious belief one of the most common in discussion be the redefinition the view of this be follow person begin by contentious when person b point out it be true person re-defines the word he use in the until he something person b be to he then record the with the person b to it continue us the but us his definition of the word in it the obscure redefinition need to get b to to it be see to be inconsistent b will tend to the point of this digression be the to the question be religious belief depend upon be by religious religion be by belief in control power in some sort of god by worship it worth point out in some of buddhism not religion to such definition be not belief in sort of power nor be it by worship in sense widen the definition of religious to tend to result in other of suddenly become religious well such science politics tv ok so it not religion but surely belief in or science be still just of like religion be firstly it not entirely be something one belief in secondly it be to number of core belief or to some sort of sense out of the sensory we experience most try to few core belief possible even those subject to question if experience throw them into doubt science number of core for it be the of physic the for observer these the sort of core if such of then everything we know must be to be on of the term lose it be more often use to refer to complete belief in something to such definition science not of of course or scientist be religious follower when something be this be not tendency however there who would be to with the universe exist be use to refer to belief without support evidence or proof doe fit definition no belief strong be closer but still doe even the most will tend to refer to or the of it when god doe not exist if be not religious surely it it be tendency to everyone either for or friend or enemy the truth be not so be the position run counter to theism in sense it be to be however when religious believer of be they the some sort of or theist this of hostile religion be quite theist in cover spectrum most live let live unless question they will not mention their except to close friend of course this be in be not in country few quite even try to convert others when possible such little on society outside the bloc country to digress slightly the soviet union to of church just like the soviet be free to worship they wish the institution of when take control of the soviet union try to destroy the church in order to complete power over the some quite their belief but only where they see religion on which not it business for the government of the such concern church should but if you do religion to in the run of the surely the the principle of the of church be the not concern of religious belief in it not only the not promote one religion the expense of but it not promote belief which be religious in religion still in discussion of purely for religious believer be responsible for reform even for in spend on foreign found religious so long they concern so long they do not on religious grind most quite to see them their in school if there no god why do you if people people who do voter tend to do thing those who do just ignore in school be to even if they tell they need not join in the diversity of religious non-religious belief it be impossible to will be to those present public event tend to friend who it be to friend their time even without other motif you mention who for foreign why there or do object to the religious there without religious purpose contribute to some contribute to religious well for the of the good they do some even do work for found on theistic most seem to feel be worth shout in connection with to them be just simple obvious so be feel it not to self-righteous to use simple excuse to plug set of religious belief to build to i do not believe in god be it like hold to be not my why the fuss be you be but be it one upbringing of rebel it be for some but people who do not to force religious or upon them of those people choose to themselves it doubtless the some religious people choose religion upbringing of be different on the other people choose religion of conform to the of others on the whole we conclude much whether or religion or conformism in people tendency to go with group or think independently how do differ from religious people they do believe in god there be to it listen to even or they prefer verdi requiem even if they know the word they shirt they dress in they even robe buddhist belief in sort of god some even copy of the bible for of course whoever you the you meet without it in but le religious people depend if you define obedience to god then of course le they do obey god but when one of one of be right wrong within society to be successful they must with other this be good enough to most from or purely for the purpose of in or simply they feel tendency to with other so why do they to others they do know they simply there some people who try to use to justify their however there people who then try to use religious belief to justify their for here be trustworthy deserve full jesus christ into the world to sinner but for very i show mercy so in me jesus christ might his unlimited for those who would believe in him receive life now to the king invisible the only god be honor glory forever ever the quote be from to the court on by jeffrey the notorious killer of wisconsin it seem for every there be religious but of more survey conduct by the roper find bear experience while only of respondent they drive before be bear do so conversion use drug before conversion two percent to in illicit sex before freethought september p so it seem best religion doe not monopoly on be there such thing if you be there such thing for then the be yes which strong those hold by religious people if you doe code then the be no by itself doe not imply much how person will most follow of the rule theist but for different view something by to the feel the world to work see it set of rule decree by be then just theist who deny god study by the freedom from religion find over of the who respond religion do not work for them they find religious belief be with they observe them not unbeliever through or they unbeliever through choice the of them spend time study one or more religion sometimes in very depth they consider decision to reject religious belief this decision of course be consequence of for person the choice of be often the only one sense hence the only choice person honestly but do to believe in god live their life though there be nobody over them of them no desire to be over no how the big brother figure might be some would like to be to believe in god but so should one believe thing merely one them to be true the risk of such should be obvious often decide to believe something be not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course see no evidence for the existence of god they unwilling in their soul to see if not most be previously religious be the seriously consider the possibility god exist spend time in try to god of course it be true some open mind but insincere be offensive closed-minded comment such of course god be there you just look properly likely to be view if you wish to in with it be you give them the benefit of the doubt they be sincere if they they for god if you not will to believe they tell the truth be futile be the whole of life completely pointless to live purposeful life they decide they think give to life they pursue those they try to their life count not by wish for life but by influence on other people who will live on for his life to reform in the hope of his on history it be tendency to look for or purpose in event however it be by no obvious life be the sort of thing to put it not everything which look like question be sensible thing to some believe be the of life be silly be the of cup of coffee they believe life no purpose or it just be so how do find comfort in time of there of comfort from friend or even pet or on le level from food or drink or tv sound empty to but so should believe in thing they comfort or should they no how it might be in the end it decision for the concern most to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely it them feel they put truth before comfort consider if for truth sometimes them feel just luck do worry they might suddenly be show to be wrong the short be no do you be for they encounter much suppose evidence for the existence of god but they find of it to be or inconclusive of of religious belief result in good proof of the existence of god therefore tend to feel they unlikely to be prove wrong in the future they stop worry it so why should theist question their belief do the no the belief be question not be the position to it nothing strong be belief theism be very strong positive belief sometimes theist should question their belief of the very they not just to the believer but to everyone else sort of religion represent huge work burden on it not just of religious believer their money on church build think of the time effort spend build church so on how effort could be better spend theist believe in there be plenty of of ill people be by priest to the medicine prescribe to them by doctor die result some theist die they refuse blood on religious grind it be the church opposition to birth control condom in be the problem of in third-world country contribute to the of world-wide religious believer be know to murder their child their child to become or someone of different religion those be believer they just to be believer some sort of excuse believer there so one true religion it to tell look there compete group convince they the only true sometimes they even fight kill other how be suppose to decide who who be when even the church like the church the church of decide themselves in the end most view decide who himself us belief or to justify his should be consider some of those just pervert for their own end but surely if the bible be so use to support it be much of code if the bible be the word of god why could he it le to misinterpret how do you know your belief perversion of your god intend if there be no single of the bible then why should one over just on your sorry but if someone he belief in jesus he murder others jesus the bible tell him to do so we must him obviously those extreme sort of belief should be question but since nobody ever prove god doe not exist it must be very unlikely more religious belief by nonsense doe not hold point out the of this positive concern the existence of entity inherently much to disprove one nobody ever prove unicorn do exist but doe it unlikely they myth it be therefore much more to hold by it be to hold positive by of course would nothing be better still well if so why there so theist the of belief little to do with how correct it be or whether it work consider how people believe in other pseudo-sciences feel it be simply to to believe in god in primitive society religion the people to with they do not of course there more to religion in the world we find people believe in religious of even when there perfectly religion of to the world but it serf other purpose well but so culture develop religion surely must something not most religion only for it worth remember religion such buddhism sort of concept of god in the sense of course most religion quick to denounce compete religion so it odd to use one religion to try justify the scientist philosopher who conclude god exist for every scientist or philosopher who belief in god there be one who doe not besides be point out the truth of belief be not determine by how people believe it it be to do not view scientist or philosopher in the theist view their religious scientist be only she be expert in some field but when she other her word no weight respect scientist themselves look foolish by on subject which lie outside their field of expertise so you belief in religion nothing not entirely it the religion in question property which help it so so the theory of memetics of meme set of which themselves between mind by with gene some view religion set of successful meme which by their host to convert others some meme destruction by believer from question doctrine or by use peer pressure to keep one-time believer from they be some religious meme even their host to destroy host control by other meme of course in the memetic view there be no virtue with successful of meme religion be not good thing of the number of people who believe it more be good thing of the number of people who it even if religion be not entirely true it put the of there promote the follow just few of them do be surprise to see which present in some religion there be more to mindlessly follow rule be of positive if you your life to some sort of it up to you to find it for be true even if it you the most of your life it the only one you it no good rely on some power to you you must yourself just something doe it good if you must something something it to test do believe thing just you them to be true most belief should be open to question for the time to this begin pgp version end pgp for pgp send to pgpinfo
