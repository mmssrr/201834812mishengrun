from subject frequently question version question this file response to which occur in point cover here one which not cover in the introduction to you to well before post these not intend to be or definitive the purpose of the periodic post be not to stifle but to it level if you something to concern one of these question which be cover by the give feel free to your point overview of content be the purpose of this newsgroup hitler the bible prof it be why it good to believe in jesus why i know god exist einstein god doe not dice everyone worship something why there must be the universe be so complex it must be design independent evidence the bible be true godel incompleteness theorem george bush on i know where hell be the be the be not subject be the purpose of this newsgroup post why newsgroup why do in group be there to discus response thing discuss here include whether it be to feign theism in order to upset one in school the child myth whether one should be overt or in the closet how religious society prey sic on new college student how to get rid of whether religion be to society the why people become of course tend to look for someone to convert most of the newsgroup do to be to few seem to derive perverse from ill-considered or uninformed post subject hitler post hitler look he do response hitler not he himself the folkish-minded in the duty in his own of orig for god will men their form their essence their who destroy his work be on the lord the divine will therefore let every be in his own if you let every it his first most duty to oppose who in his by word or deed step outside the confine of his religious community try to butt into the other hence i believe i in with the will of the orig hitler from mein of course someone believe something doe not belief wrong it entirely possible hitler lie when he to believe in god we conclude he though subject the bible prof it post in the bible it response most of the of feel the bible be of it write of by who be record exist before thus in it be of this be to the bible no truth in it simply truth must be before be of the of this group feel be subject to one thing one thing only be not note this feel tend to extend to other book it be to theist tend to ignore other religious book in of those of their own religion subject post if you believe in god turn out to be incorrect you lose nothing but if you do believe in god turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it be foolish to be response this be know it firstly it doe not which religion to follow indeed there exclusive religion out there this be often describe the the wrong hell problem if person be follower of religion x he end up in religion y version of hell secondly the if you believe in god turn out to be incorrect you lose nothing be not true suppose you believe in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider the result from people reject medicine in of in the be it be on the the two possibility likely or they of likelihood if in the possibility of there be god be close to the become much le so the be only likely to convince those who believe feel for honest people belief be on evidence with some of intuition it be not of will or cost-benefit the consist of four one doe not know whether god exist not believe in god be for one soul if god doe exist believe in god be of no consequence if god doe not exist therefore it be in one interest to believe in god there two to the the first be to view consequence of it one problem with this in the be it from no this be consider in theory one no god but be from the of god this entropy be from no no cost the be to both the problem with this be be then which the position only will with the thus to if you it be in your interest to believe in god not the intend the to be view the biggest why be be if god be omniscient he will know who belief who belief he will spurn the he whether people believe in him subject be post people keep be it response of principle which become know in it form it do not multiply entity be if you something without suppose the existence of some entity then do so when people refer to they express it more for the simplest solution the to be we look two possible for we see u there be incredibly complex universe out there which into be result of process there be incredibly complex universe out there there be god who the universe this god must be of complexity give both fit the might suggest we should the simpler of the two solution number one some there be third even more simple solution there be incredibly complex universe out there we just there be this third option u solipsism which people find subject why it good to believe in jesus post i to tell people the virtue benefit of my religion response be not feel free to your religion but do not write post on conversion theme such post do not belong on will be reject from try the newsgroup you would doubtless not welcome post from to your newsgroup in to convert you do unto others you would them do unto you often theist their god in the form of lengthy or be of god know the him if the sole purpose of your be to tell god exist bring you well not post it since it tell u nothing we not be tell before subject why i know god exist post i know from experience god exist response just theist evidence the be they worship exist so evidence such be do not exist evidence from person to person furthermore without wish to dismiss your evidence out of people kind of unlikely thing they be by ufo visit by the ghost of elvis so on subject einstein god doe not dice post einstein believe in god do you think you cleverer him response einstein do once comment god doe not dice with the universe this be commonly mention to show einstein believe in the god use this it be out of context it refer to einstein to the by theory furthermore einstein religious jewish better show einstein think god be the follow i believe in god who himself in the orderly of exist not in god who concern himself with of be einstein to theory of his belief in objective orderly which would not be subject to event which would not be dependent upon the observer he believe qm incomplete better theory would no need for so no such better theory be find much evidence suggest it never will be longer quote from einstein in science philosophy religion symposium publish by the conference on science philosophy religion in their to the of life inc new york in it he the more be imbue with the order of event the firmer become his conviction there be no room leave by the side of this order for of different for him neither the rule of nor the rule of divine will exist independent of event to be sure the doctrine of god interfere with event could never be refute his in the sense by science for this doctrine refuge in those in which scientific knowledge not yet be to set foot but i convince such on the of of religion would not only be unworthy but for doctrine which be to itself not in light but only in the will of necessity lose it effect on with to progress in their struggle for the good of religion must the to give up the doctrine of god be give up source of hope which in the such power in the of priest in their they will to themselves of those force which of the good the true the in itself this be to be sure more difficult but more worthy einstein it of course lie you my religous conviction lie which be be i do not believe in god i never deny this but express it if something be in me which be religious then it be the unbounded for the structure of the world so our science it the quote be from einstein the side edit by helen publish by princeton university press from the book i do not believe in of the i consider ethic to be exclusively concern with no behind it of course the einstein choose not to believe in doe not in itself imply be subject everyone worship something post everyone worship something whether it money power or god response if be true everyone be polytheist theist just much those thing if the to for their to worship then so do the theist subject why there must be post set of integer lower bind member so of must first element response the set of number definite lower bind but no member further even if it be true there must be doe not imply must be conscious entity not such entity must the description by religion subject the universe be so complex it must be design post the presence of design in the universe prof there be god surely you do think this here just by response this be know the from design it be of dispute whether there be element of design in the universe those who believe the complexity diversity of live on the be evidence of best to the newsgroup for while there be insufficient to both side of here however the conclusion be there be no scientific evidence in of scientific furthermore there be much evidence theory of the complexity of the universe life on the origin of the by design be feel the existence of something incredibly be so surely it come by surely there must be some intelligence direct thing so come from the but if intelligence be so surely the existence of mind of entire universe complete with conscious be must be more unlikely the use to in of the existence of be turn to the position this u to the theme of if the universe the but with the of the only out be to the not just be or from here we might well be wrong with the universe just be without introduce indeed stephen in his book brief history of time his theory the universe be close finite in extent with no begin or end the from design be often by in the one be to one find on the doe one it by or it evolve of course one yet like the the universe be complex so the go the universe too must the suffer from three over those common to by design firstly from pre-existing god be to the universe from nothing these two sort of different the be therefore secondly but there other thing in the world if we further the find we would it by the the would therefore suggest multitude of responsible for different of in the first of the we conclude the be not of it be order therefore out from the of yet in the second of the we from the position the universe be obviously not but show element of order the be thus inconsistent subject independent evidence the bible be true post the event of the new confirm by independent evidence for response the write of josephus often mention independent evidence version of josephus work think not to mention jesus or the version discus john in context believe the mention jesus in but this by copyist reconstruction of the text be publish to this effect much in the history of eusebius it be worthless of the of the wily eusebius who be first thoroughly dishonest of it be eusebius who be give the title of for this from the new the jesus be more well-documented for further consult the frequently question file for the newsgroup subject godel incompleteness theorem post godel incompleteness theorem it be impossible for the bible to be both true complete response godel first incompleteness theorem in consistent system which be sufficiently expressive it model one expression which never be prove to be or or within system the system must be recursive be there must be decision procedure for determine whether give string be within the system such system be know the sentence in english be this sentence be note if proposition be the system not even deduce it be the logic use in discussion be well define so godel incompleteness theorem it be impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god worthless in one define system in which it be possible to prove the existence of god simply by the existence of god this be unlikely to be view by convince proof however it be possible to succeed in produce system build on both theist with it then be possible to show godel incompleteness theorem hold for system however would still not it be impossible to prove god exist within the system furthermore it would tell u whether it be possible to prove the existence of god note of these system tell u nothing the existence of god the system just frequent be godel incompleteness theorem religious text the bible the book of mormon or not be both consistent religious text not system so such nonsense subject george bush on post do
