from subject re theism genocide in benedikt write in ook write theism be strongly with belief in belief in be strongly with deletion theism be with i neither be by theism nor theism to the point be theism the of become one could of course would be tend theism for but i just to loook the time in history when theism the ideology to conclusion be the behind it imo the influence of or for your theism be the to be consider bogus i just theism be not the only for the point be theism be your now it up i consider your useful the follow belief be strongly with therefore belief be in true utterly useless note this be belief not belief in god tire to the i it up the first i it conspicuous by it be evidence or point the be the of the wrong someone belief something be the person someone be theist hold much more further the between theist be higher between belief of the of theistic belief truth by evidence gullibility blind obedience to of scepticism so on more the people the source of often none of these thing they of the gullible who know precisely they do you to support note in the field of theism the believe they if you believe you incredibly you live in world i wonder if there be of discussion leave such of i think you of even when one with something one doe not believe one get fool into believe one to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your the onus of proof be on you sunshine you think theist believe they when they one thing do or one thing closely follow by it opposite the be not restrict to theism but it there for to see it epidemic in this country just for if it be for to thru the eye of needle why be the church such why there church to the inch in my country now some of theism more precisely some theist do tend to i you to theist with this brush be bigotry not it to me like for censorship restriction of religious freedom ever in discussion with you one to it i write not every theism to not be by theism the point be there be it come from of theism no some of it come from which some theism in common with some your simply be imply by you before you try to in of theism the word you grope for be some bogus not theism be be however the rest give for the the theism further the of other theistic belief them to switch to it just nifty improvement in the theology truth by gullibility by the be one of them no shit sherlock so why not gullibility of theism since it seem whole lot more to the you oppose to the you try to there be more theism the to gullible people the the whole discussion by the theism be to which you indeed i do i i for evidence be the of which you to i go to forbid religion be of your men interest you nothing better to offer i it like up to it bogus no other use nice split in the mind of people such to be find on either side of church i quite well give everyone their right protect me better from the other round of course other people never oneself your wish to slur theist seem pretty to me it be quite nice to see you imply connection between the rise of so it be just of your so you do it define belief be it to believe be useful belief be belief be not upon the be discuss for long time with one point be the belief often process doe not lend itself to doe not well there be here be useful on would be not on would be which be it bogus self reference be not since the of usefulness be possible within system it be it it still beg the question however though be it not you to be of your no proof no evidence just hey i it from you do i do good the risk of myself we before we do before so we with it you use to be useful someone who think be wo buy it you see be even for you the imply my proof depend on their opinion somehow who doe not there wo wow incredible insight i do to prove them wrong in their opinion it be possible to show their system out useful respectively or even to be useless their wish to believe them believe thing judge by their not by their it you feel good when you believe be good for them but it of possible from belief despite evidence to the bogus proof they truth by i see bogus proof of the non-existence of god i of their existence system by the doe not every to come from the point be the of the doe not logic it follow such system doe not to if it in itself yes it be possible to it be in system be not by the of system but since the of the be upon little the possibility of demon this just doe sorry so it just of consistency i use to show my system be consistent or theirs be the of the nor this prediction doe not need it doe not however your be silly prove need therfore else think godel silly of consciousness type be suppose to the first of the second no you do the belief if the belief strong theism strong then your be not in true the second of your sentence be doe not lend itself to but be to of process be use to it i be of religious system with definition of god here lend itself to you here be often refute look the discussion of the of choice further one in system out of which they derive i exist be derive if you it further one test the consistency so on of set of be it you try to some point people wind up this be for no i not nope there be evidence for it the trick be the choice of of system be difficult the possibility interweave one therefore choose with the or with to get out of the system i like to see this evidence one doe not need to define in order to define method for usefulness the be by how one feel not how one feel it i see you no belief but then never do do they the evidence theist for their to the strength of their the whole thing not only but i with this until you specific which theism to theism be require proof which i suspect you do not use the definition of god entity with objective effect on this world connect to the the world work imo belief such god be doe not people who hold them in principle oppose to the exercise of intelligence some scientist for they do use theism when do science or it would be science note subjective lend themselves to scientific well they just prohibit them objective ergo nothing be objective enough the to be see it to be true i believe it be nothing more work hypothesis however the belief they more work hypothesis i do this you your person belief system b it sound so nice doe not b true it be best work hypothesis however the content of b be it be true it be more work hypothesis test or evidence for or it therefore dismiss b believe it be wrong of time not possible depend on the further content of b to be kill this interest effect definition of interest but sure now show belief in god the further content of which you why my neighbour out kill the for they do believe in it it the conjunction of b b dissenter be the belief in god be entirely it seem so to me but then i no to grind here the with your neighbour be your neighbour do little others there be time when nope it not it just doe go to the you wish to see tell me when it be not why such in the holy book note one could edit them out when they not god do err doe excuse me the holy book how come we theist genocide order by god ok god be the to excuse therefore highly to not to mention the effect by these on the rest of the believer god be neither the to excuse nor the only not odwyer from hen by evelyn conlon
