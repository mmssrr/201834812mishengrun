from hudson hudson jr subject re on in hedrick write this from here his response kinsey see below be the source of the figure percent there in few month show the result of study only be i figure list the figure of course even if it be would little on whether or not it be sinful how people commit other of how people lie or sin in other but in the of their be reflection of the of the people not specific of why be it specific of describe men with men work which be unseemly to describe the sure there like the other sin the the other the other sin from their which result of not glorify god god be still their be or even consider it in some on the other none of these explicit on the subject rom be it refer to in be everything sinful on in the new scripture doe not condemn be drug be rule by the spirit the letter not only free from it protect u from sin the spirit the word be two edge sword cut both i think we must be before we throw out leviticus if the be reflection of god true holy then those who god endorse run into problem if be wholesome endorse by god those who oppose biggots some would u believe why be there of it in leviticus this be in the midst of the other sex sin there be nothing in the text to this limit to temple prostitution no good to believe this the furthermore sex crime be every sin on in the new look i one of the break not even of the gentile one should his wife there be prohibition your wife in leviticus no other new verse condemn it besides this one notice do not the sin in commit etc he speak one wife notice this in leviticus be not mention in the specific context of either there no coustom mention in i either of one wife even do the gentile it just sin whether worship idol involve or not one commonly be simply never the kind of question we try to with he encounter only in context where most people would it wrong he never the experience of who try to he never who try to define which fit with of fidelity of see mirror of the between god it be to judgement on use it to judgement on these question one of the some of u do not common be do this other problem sin be tough to over come without power be sin more difficult to overcome sin like lust or sleep with people of the opposite sex i doubt it even if it be be no excuse god be of it we reject it be it ignore the power of god to intervene in this kind of how people be set free from sin by the power of god sure there be group try to be reflection on the people involve in the not god willingness to sinner us people need be the power of god to them whether they involve in sin or other sin i the question of how to counsel be not entirely issue but one tendency we see in issue such be to be uncompromising on principle but in issue to look very the good of the people involve to insist on perfection when it would be for while believe it to he u to push people into do which they i do see how you come to conclusion with issue people to give up their liberty in order to others not to people to continue in sin it just too difficult the of offer to idol felt there nothing wrong in sense with the yet he believer to their liberty to in order to others but never people to sin live holy just to tough write to no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof then he go in to discourse on how we should our own liberty in order to the conscience of others suppose it be not sin for people to since others consider it to be sin then use on issue those who would otherwise be should their liberty be or to member of the opposite sex never offer lesser sin to prevent people from in be consider more sin for obviously would prefer to see people in some yet if they be to do so he would see them in where they might be tempt to yet itself be not sin be holy in something god this note in the story work enter life result of sin this doe stop work when we put in the to tend to it before he fell he fell he would to toil over the grind the of try to cure it the most often when it doe you end up with from to suicide well break when live be why we dependent on god glorious position to be it we must be by the renew of our mind be the only in freedom just like else but i well prefer to see people in long-term commit promiscuity with work which genesis suggest of god either i think such still be vehicle for people god love with other i sure you see how people with the oppose view see this conclusion it like how should i kill myself with gun or the person who just be overcome with desire to sleep with would it be better for him to sleep with one or of them the person who to sleep with his would it be better for him to sleep with one or of them in these the more people or one sleep with the higher the they will get but this only with of the question whichever sin be commit it to cent the when their different the greek would be with this be the kind of be be collector the issue be most often in scripture seem to be the second be it snobbery to only of this century of love there write glorify love btw i one who belief in from where do you get collector sinner not explicit jesus do tell to quit his job link hudson i to comment in this in our concept of the intention of jesus different i in the the of word i still think they it doe seem consider the he him wrong you do with this depend upon your to the bible i between be even between in the cent since you with my point obviously you go to with of the discussion conclusion sometimes discussion be still useful i see some very interest work on do by jew obviously they do with him but they sometimes helpful insight into he but i do see much sign for hope here in there by the time hitler be invoke hope for sensible discussion be go on this subject when sleep with be invoke i do think there enough for to be worth pursue clh
