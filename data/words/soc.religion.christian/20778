from kempmp petri pihko subject re view on re jeesus in your first i collectively people who give good to my question in my follow-up to smith post i will some issue smith write in kempmp petri pihko write i concede i doubly remiss i no exist entirely subjective on my one could be give time further discovery by the scientist i prove theory doe not specify this be how it but propose likely description of the in question i with this yes to some degree there excellent discussion in on the of scientific work two week i hope it do not your notice the correct word be there be no to be sure our model theory correct theory up by evidence but not prove no theory be in sense however theory not mere description or of it be extremely to test whether theory predict something new or not yet observe successful theory science come up with this test include the big theory of cosmic evolution the theory of selection etc it doe not they must be correct but they not mere fit for the but if you there must be to how do the universe our emerge from nothing science some good for of which require something we to well yes if you to believe in them this be not science require good look the theory the evidence see if the theory successful prediction use your disbeliever not punish the there belie none conclusive with out conclusive evidence we leave with this be me why do we need to in my fellow would me someone who be to believe ie to belief in god yes i know one believe without god help luther this quite in his letter to i this doe not my couple of delete we why doe the universe exist i think this question should be split into two why be there existence why exist how do the universe emerge from nothing deletion the question why exist be counter by to question why there be nothing in nothingness or in non-existence both question turn out to be devoid of thing exist do thing do exist do exist it best the question then the counter-question the first why while the second be request for definition no it be not it doe look like one this be true dichotomy either something exist or nothing exist if nothing exist nobody would why if something exist it be possible to why but no exist be could give for moment the nobody in non-existence could why nothing exist this be to my counter-question why nothing exist in nothingness now why exist be to why something exist in somethingness this be i with my my for the poor word in my previous post i might the worldview of thing exist do thing do do be ground in the of the doe the theist belief in god it be on the there be not for be something un the position of there be it very exist in the soil of one who there be i do indeed think there be no for be or existence in for i however they will still open the question why this not this be where theistic come in science not give for be existence we come to this either i therefore i or i for this be deep question be determinism true or not be god deterministic or not i tend to think this question no in his if i for i yet to see it would be from our perspective it look like exist for truly i just roll two dice why do i get how i believe there be better for my existence if the former be then you do for you need not doctor if the your be just begin yes i with this until i find something better my of be of no help in this respect i to but i be god be the source of existence this sound much better but i tempt to doe god himself exist then if god be the source of his own existence it only he in term of time exist but this be not the the source of existence this doe not preclude his existence it only seek to identify his imply he exist to btw no it doe but i think exist god not know why he exist for to this question be not of course this should not be to belief in his existence i discover science be tool to why it m pihko we see but tool be to question doe not preclude the question be question doe not provide it be impossible to know thing however the question why do i exist in be not question this be not i but from our perspective it be impossible to tell i just believe in give of since i find i delude myself my i use why why do this come to be why do pre-existence become existence why do become i think pre-existence be oxymoron there be no time of this except in some other universe from perspective our universe never it exist only for those who inside it but we come to the science to why it be in the of modern science doe the question no the of the question to be discuss i think philosophy be of help here be know be not m pihko doe present good point though we need to do i my on will it be by the production of evidence our cow or will we seek to if new discovery truly with god continue to in his word this be very good question in try to this numerous other question bother me i find nothing to my on i think it would be honest if we ourselves why do i believe or why i do believe petri petri pihko kem-pmp be the truth c physic be the rule of oulu kempmp the chemistry be the
