from mserv server subject of note i this reply into due to length ml siemon write in mserv someone write ml siemon write indeed check out these verse some of them use u only through incredibly perverse others simply do not the issue i see some of the verse do not the issue there verse the issue i there no verse go by right but if there verse the issue doe there no verse support your you sure you to there verse the issue however couple of them seem though they do not require incredibly perverse in order to be see condemn the kind of i see incredibly perverse be to the story of sodom if it be of since cite the bible in such context should be presume to the story it to to use u the story in genesis tell of the of sodom opportunity to know the two men who be lot guest the the sodomite when lot offer them his could be see they be interest only in intercourse yes they everybody be wrong some believe the of their desire just sinful the of their desire the doe not it so offend god whether it the or the intend or both but i believe it be only to consider the possible in the light of scripture i do not believe those who believe god offend by both the the try to be itself form of you seem to the view the only sin describe in gen be in the the sodomite to commit it be to their by it with the sin of i see how you might such conclusion if you from the conclusion there be nothing wrong with but then we not suppose to from our conclusion if god be in oppose to intercourse in then the more be he offend by the sodomite he by their intent to commit on i will document why i believe the old god one who despise intercourse even if both consent do not be deceive neither nor nor nor nor nor thief nor the covetous nor nor revilers nor swindler inherit the kingdom of god such be some of you i cor the discus the of your use of in this the find my to be in he the church the proper for determine kind of would be thus the church to pervert my question however nothing to do with the church new kind of so his something of in term of my question the precise of be unless you try to the bible doe condemn sex i not sure the try to do in i think both you the miss the point here when jesus divorce he reply you not he who them from the begin them this his mother to his wife the two become one flesh consequently they no longer two but one flesh therefore god join together let no mt i here the union of his wife be union in other word the institution of be something by god not by men not by the church but by god men not suppose to dissolve this union in jesus word it be not something by men this be not this be just god word i in the bible god the union of i do not of union of two or two there be uninspired men who union be report to his horse but the only union jesus refer to god join together be the union of his wife me for mention i know i should it for the discussion on in of this post hold off on judgement on me until you section of my reply my question not whether we should in condemn only select few kind of sex my question give be the only union describe by the bible give prohibition sex outside of be intercourse sinful of course i see now first we need to whether the bible condemn sex outside of you seem to be try to only kind of sex other sin wrong i think we with there some kind of could be by or theft or covet or revile or drunkenness which would well deserve we or not to the bind of those however the very they over suggest not only be the not but excellent no interest in them to our spirit-led decision with the discussion of these it be the definition of such term the rest in we would the the tutor by god to u to christ just spend some sixteen century drum into the of god people the thing like intercourse be deserve punishment by do go into on c be he consider the question to be with the god prophet do not devote of time define distinct new he do not intend in the he by the i discus the in below but i just to point out the new to develop new of be not evidence god doe not conduct of put people to for be no different i the other i know in condemn or child or even the possibly but obsessive kind of sex or would condemn by in the very of the you cite i mildly suggest doe in his letter you to use be good guide to his free to do you yes but not everything be for my good no doubt i free to do but i for one will not let free with me cor which be we must no other god before god neither i nor other wish to some people indeed involve in obsessively drive mode of it be just wrong though slightly le so it from the contingent to with such to it with the of god messenger how do you define obsessively drive mode of how do you determine the difference between obsessive sex drive be the desire to sinful sex obsessively drive mode of i think you see this be why be it define sinful it be obsessive it obsessive the the person be drive to seek it even though it sinful or be it obsessive it be desire for which society condemn once why be it define obsessive the person it even though society condemn it why doe society condemn it it be obsessive you seem to be try to limit the bible of to only pervert sex but i do think you define pervert without into the you me of then be condemn when he not enter the kindgom of i wo with the exegesis of leviticus except very you exhibit the here in your you know i think you misunderstand me i not try to on some definition of i the issue of the sinfulness of sex the of evidence of to the union of couple there plenty of prohibit to be find in leviticus most of which ignore completely they never even bother to them they just they know which one which one well i news for you course should you to v in lot of society we them too but bury pretty deep i not see grind for distinguish these bite of leviticus from the which no i know feel to u i serious here when people go on they do in this how repulsive our do they know it huh it be solid clue to the sort of the prejudice insect remember you just here for when we discus in on other your conclusion you the intercourse in leviticus be not of the i you would you if god condemn intercourse even those who not under the of moses then this would show god of go beyond the if i show you from scripture god punish the of people who be not under the of moses would you god definition of intercourse be not limit to just the those who under the i be discussion with on the subject of the my point requirement be nowhere in scripture doe god gentile to rest on the nor doe he ever condemn gentile for to rest on the this the difference between requirement such thou not kill requirement merely of the jews-only of moses such the the point you try to be you think the of intercourse be just of the jews-only of moses i on the other believe it by god for gentile well jew he punish those guilty of this by or exile here why in genesis god promise to give the then in the possession of the on the do you think but in verse we clue this might not be unjust it sound it seem god be go to postpone this for quite while the iniquity of the be not yet complete remember this be long before there then the iniquity the commit when complete would justify his be out of his own kill go look lev verse list of sin include child incest begin in verse god do not defile yourselves by of these thing for thing the which i out before you for the become defile therefore i visit it punishment upon it so the spew out it for whoever doe of these those person who do so be cut off from their people notice god the gentile who not under the of moses to be punish they defile themselves their by commit include incest flip two to lev you will find these list this time god decree the on involve in of these thing include lie with one lie with lv their bloodguiltiness upon them in god eye they deserve to die for do such thing to lev even the non-jew who sojourn you to from these on of be cut off by god from their people under the i believe it would be very difficult to support the in the old god object only to the intend not the in sodom since god take the trouble to list sex between two consent men one of the for wipe out the not mind you but sex i god not on the subject of even by those who nothing to do with the for those who do think some of leviticus be for while others not even to be think it be incumbent on you in every on it own merit to determine why you pick one ignore to ii tim scripture be inspire by god be for reproof correction in righteousness thus i believe even though we gentile not under the we from study it if be define sin it be of the then it be sin only for those who under the for in the of where god even for those who not under the then i conclude god objection to the be not on whether or not person be under the but on the sinfulness of the itself in the of intercourse be define by god defile for gentile well jew for those who not under the well for those who thus i not try to gentile to keep of the i simply god refer to sin even for those who not to keep the if this be so then i do not think we to our exemption from the grind for god bloodguilty defile both jew gentile continue in
