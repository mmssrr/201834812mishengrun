from d byler subject the nicene creed re view of the trinity bushnell write the creed of however be western creed the filioque the orthodox they it with the exception of the filioque but it be not in use which be i point out though i wrong your use of the creed the in which i it the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque the creed the filioque the nicene do not of course the orthodox do not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it there to begin with but they do from the creed which do it from the begin i might point out the whole problem over the difference in of the of the bless trinity the the of the holy spirit proceed from the through the son the west use proceed from the the son in some such use both see below follow therefore the form of these i profess i do god his word the his son two for the root the stem two thing but conjoin the the river two kind but indivisible the sun the two form but coherent one which proceed from must be second to from which it proceed but it be not on from it where there be second however there two where ther be third there three the spirit then be third from god the son just the third from the root be the fruit of the stem third from the be the from the river thrid from the sun be the of the i believe the spirit proceed not otherwise from the through the son st show in his question there be no between the two method of in the two method of reckon the procession st others the holy spirit proceed from the the son but he proceed from the in more preeminent for the son he from the he it from the the holy spirit proceed from him for the be not from for which he be unbegotten not indeed in the scripture but in the of of those who employ such term they in so the son however be bear of the the holy spirit proceed from the since the give to the son he without of time the holy spirit proceed jointly from both son he would be son of the of the son if which be to everyone of sound mind they both beget him the spirit not beget by however but proceed from both st of hippo the trinity to so in sense of the correct to the west the holy spirit proceed from both son but in proceed from the son the orgin of procession be the procession from the so the holy spirit be proceed from the through the son but the son be from the the holy spirit be to proceed from the without mention of the son be in i to know i follow in the belief of pope st leo i st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of pope st i st of hippo st of st of st of poitier others the who very quote support the position which i for the issue of the of creed be forbid i will point out the holy of ephesus both speak of the creed of in their forbid to produce write or compose confession of other the one define by the of creed be different creed of which be commonly the nicene creed not of course in they be condemn the of the creed which be but upon the creed of but they be condemn the impious opinion of nestorious who different creed from the one use by the church which other thing deny the procession of the holy spirit form the son thus the of the creed be not think to be in of this the council the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestorius deny they could be in fuller the creed for they themselves of previous to it if the further of the creed in be not of the work do by the holy of or in it follow the council of toledo fully to not dispute by the to the creed so to the impiety of the in the filioque not in dispute in the church until under photius others the filioque not dispute i provide more quote below since the holy spirit when he be in u effect our be conform to god he proceed from the son it be he be of the divine essence in it in essence proceed from it st cyril of the of the holy trinity thesis the holy spirit be not of the only or of the son only but he be the spirit of the the son for it be write if love the world the spirit of the be not in him it be write if however doe not the spirit of christ he be none of his when the the son in this the holy spirit be understand of whom the son himself in the gospel the holy spirit proceed from the he receive of mine it to you pope st i the decree of the only-begotten holy spirit neither the of the son nor the of but be holy spirit be not foreign to the for the only-begotten himself him the spirit of the of him the he proceed from the will receive of mine so he be reckon not be foreign to the son but be of their of the he be spirit divine of god he be god for he be spirit of god spirit of the spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis like soul body in u but in the midst of son of the of the son third by the exist the son exist the spirit from the the son neither be the son nor be the spirit st of which be on cyprus the concern the holy spirit i ought not to silent nor yet be it to still on of those who do not know him it be not possible for me to be silent however it be to of him who must be who be from the the son his source st of poitier the trintiy to thus i point out before egypt the of the greek of christnedom time who be cite to show they confess the doctrine express by the filioque i suggest to those of the orthodox church they come up with some of the besides st john of who will deny the filioque to support their view it be not enough to bring up the proceed from the line of the creed or the gospel of john for we believe but it doe not the holy spirit doe not proceed from the son only he doe proceed from the byler
