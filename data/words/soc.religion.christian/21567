one-over one this by critic in the first of the people felt they do not to be of the new they leave but others come into the new boston church of christ but i of myself the system begin to it toll on the member they felt they be work but they be not the result be so the number be drop from membership decline the to tighten the reign on the who see be unproductive unfruitful the fruit in the nt be interpret refer to new convert if you be not fruit john you would be into the fire boston still this if you love your neighbor you his soul invite him to church convert him if you not do you do love your neighbor if you do love you in of the continue in this vein in chuck fire from his job minister due to recur sin in his life these struggle be never to the people outside the them for by now there very little on friendship level between most member those outside if you your focus should be on convert them bring them to bible study chuck joe wood who fully supportive of the boston system
