from ml siemon subject re nt of conviction of sin ii let me return to the question his use of to refer more or le to the prohibition of sex in order to bring out the problem most i i think be le coin the term for this the question i to turn to be would for for this should be shorter my note we will see this question confront u with some of the division within christ body i not try to open the for of the terrible of u from our fellow my own loosely will be evident but i not grind here so much try to get to see it be to closure when the issue involve strike the of we in our own different see to the gospel of christ so intent the question be how his this intent follow on question there be second one be our proper if we do to him since give not single clue his in the text of there two positive one to this question or or someone in the community convey to the the jewish condem of expect them to be sufficiently well-tutored by this he need no futher i should note there be no evidence in the letter or in for such supposition b the spirit will u or if not god behind inspire word-choice c we know not guess to within better pre cision here for in the use by in the of the word those who more if you think be obvious from it root try cut your teeth on this word the neb it or even methusoi this the of be common insult so there be some hint to it the three position more or le if i be some for the of define one form of for evidence three position strength it be the gospel in by the community of christ disciple their successor our nt scripture itself emerge from this but it the we know little or nothing this until century which be to we to the only of possibly confuse the scripture be itself our only of the in the b if we not bear of spirit to revert to john in to then we no more hope of under the gospel nicodemus neither the of men nor the of our own prevent the spirit from blow where it will the be but the downside of belief in the of the spirit our guide in scripture be the wing of this most seriously be the most over divergent supposedly derive from the word of god note think scripture to be within even while reserve judgment out of scripture the more form of i will scripture my fringe of cultic the problem with this be there be no for one person to convey to one feel be receive from the spirit history show incredible conflict between on this point in his own mind convince he be lead by the spirit no one seriously urge point b without some sense of it for set to purpose c the the distinct when it conclusion it out the in which be open to the be obvious this be not possible if i word here out of my own one methodology be it dissolve but surely not honestly the of evidence problem which mere theology be helpless to there be serious possibility of schism between position mostly on the of extreme of position b c sense of tend to of b c to position so despite horrendous rome be not likely to find these issue divisive the world will will i predict muddle through on the to give position it due but no more it due second question suppose tell u lot of tell u think possible be refer to prohibition sex then we our responsi bility to let it the but it precisely where inherit not question they most we of christ question the their use of despite his urge in we to heed them we of peter more still jettison the they be lead by the spirit to into question jesus peter do not so much throw out subject it to criticism on couple of very grind the weightier of the justice mercy good on these two love god neighbor the whole the prophet if there be derive from christ in the to some lead the first to go so to of the to gentile convert beyond be directly deducible from jesus report word deed it signify to me of the to only the we specific in open to through men of men god u even so these source of our instruction i will freely but be inherently inherently corruptible give the corrupt nothing in it be immune to when the spirit show u in justice mercy good nothing unless it doe follow from love of god love of neighbor i perfectly will to i could be blind to my own sin the spirit she refuse to me or i too dense to might here but i know of be on one some superstitious to in minor sodomite the of the so offense if be in with the gospel of christ then i no be it most vicious i see nothing much different in the unbidden eruption onto usenet of people who quick to condemn but slow to if be the of the spirit then i no of it but i find in obedience to the lord be i myself dependent on the witness of other for the truth life in the body of christ i to who doubt be from god to doubt who would suppress the church be how you with these people if this enterprise this movement of theirs be of origin it will up of it own but if it doe in come from god you will not only be to destroy them but you might find yourselves fight god i be you listen to your your scripture with mind soul open to the spirit to the history of our first witness willingness to other of scripture though with the of scribe submission to the must depend on the love of god neighbor then study the evidence the history of oppress out of their to judge where jesus tell u not to judge let the witness of the spirit in the life of your fellow include those who not of your preference in theology guide you god truth l siemon i you god son of the ml most high of you nevertheless or you die like men ml like prince there in your discussion of position to whether you of in time or ours i think there two to use one be to when his it sense to interpret his word in the context of me think these over word turn out to be silly we know out of on sex everything else he on sex be consistent with the tone of his on in rom be consistent with even if the word in the sin list the most term for it seem to me there some evidence they not they just one more piece of evidence for something we would be will to believe with no evidence the common jewish rejection of but when you identify with the position horse of different color the position involve continue church specific to might be we get on how to interpret from the the church interpret him we confidence his prohibition still in our time of the judgement of the church between his time ours i think this be different use of might be will to use know cent to but not use the position to the question of our own to should be clh
