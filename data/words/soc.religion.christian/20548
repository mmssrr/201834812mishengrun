from sysops subject the empty tomb the empty tomb we trust it by the wilbur m smith when jesus on he prediction himself frequently it let me quote it for you behold we go up to the son of be unto the chief priest unto the scribe they condemn him to deliver him to the gentile to mock to scourge to crucify him the third he rise wholly different from the experience of men jesus who never do worthy of even deserve know he would die before he of he know the very city where he would die he know the religious of his own would condemn him to he know one of his own would him he know before his take he would be mock scourge he know how he would die by crucifixion this be in itself but more the minute of his foreknowledge he predict would follow shortly he bury he would rise he even the time on the third but since it be on this the resurrec tion of jesus christ the whole truth or untruth of chris turn let u it more closely the body of jesus in long sheet of cloth between the of which of spice ointment distribute the body in tomb which never before be use stone roll the the jewish fully jesus predict he would rise the stone on before the tomb to prevent the disciple from the body morning some of the woman who be follower of christ go out to the tomb to further the body to their utter they find the stone roll the body go they rush to tell the disciple shortly two of jesus friend peter john utterly the whole find the tomb empty just the woman even the hurry into the city to tell the hire them to the tomb the body go how do this tomb become empty one of the most new in professor of new in write to the in to my question of how the tomb empty write it in letter not by bitterness or he could no more how the tomb empty he could how come down the chimney time but he do never do come down chimney time there never there be jesus he die he bury in the tomb of joseph of on the body go those of history no one the responsi bility of come to some conclusion by mention myth we before we be eight old professor dr kirsopp of university try to the empty tomb by no other in the field of new criticism venture to the woman go to the wrong tomb the these first so we know there no other tomb to which by they could go second it be to experience for three or more people to forget the where they bury their love one within le three even if the woman do miss the tomb when peter john do they too go to the wrong tomb third be the soldier the wrong tomb there be of course record of to the evidence of the empty tomb in the new itself now when they be go behold some of the into the city show unto the chief priest the thing be do when they be with the counsel they money unto the soldier ye his disciple by night steal him while we sleep if this come to the governor we will him secure you so they take the money do they be this be com monly report the jew until this this be good of to the the tomb empty you will notice once the chief priest the elder never question but the tomb empty they never even go out to see if the report true they know it true this story it ridiculous to the tomb empty the soldier be tell to jesus disciple steal the body while they the soldier be how could they know go on while they be obviously such testimony would be in court even from the sordidness u reject the the very the history of the disciple compel u to believe they do not secretly the body of jesus first professor heffern point out the of in who put the lord jesus to nothing to offer to these disciple they continue to jesus his resurrection know the tomb empty if there be trickery here sooner or it would be suspect then prove second surely one of the disciple even most of them would confess the under the terrific persecution they undergo it be possible to live lie but men seldom die for lie most of these men do the result would be the christ rise would suffer the of such unfounded story it would lose it power this truth sweep the world close temple win million of disciple bring hope to the very truth of the church be freshly glorious ever but not only do jesus come he do not to the disciple through the subsequent to to him he to them visibly frequently he to the woman the tomb on resurrection morning to john to simon peter luke in the he with two of his follower luke night he to ten of the together in upper room luke etc week he to eleven of the the john once he see by brother on in i to the just before his luke with the of the empty tomb so in to these histor record kind of theory be propose to deny their but these theory without support evidence none ever win the of those who refuse to believe in the of the moreover while it be true we live in when of our scientist of our philosopher let u not forget some of the thinker of the firmly believe in this president of timothy dwight president of lord president of hitchcock president of hopkins president of john witherspoon president of princeton these men countless others believe it but suppose christ do rise from the of it it to do with my life it to do with your life just this it with certitude the of christ jesus truth himself he to come down from god he he the to god he he the son of god who know god perfectly he whoever believe on him life no one else it he we god in his he would it to u thus when he do rise from the on the third he in these prediction he speak the truth do you know good why we should not believe his word true the point be doe not the truth of the resurrection convince u he be none other the one he to be the son of god then of course the christ rise from the testify he break the power of he will some u up from the he promise in other word if this person jesus christ the son of god in this he should be the cornerstone of the of your life for he life build on him would know forgiveness of sin his ionship help joy no ever hope shineth more more unto perfect those who try it down through the there be give their testimony we who believe know
