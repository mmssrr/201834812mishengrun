from ml siemon subject re nt of conviction of sin or in rexlex write i post it once so it will come piece not i look to it when i get to the week it with the object in view to look some over the few since my previous look the un they move the so i do get look the i hop to find i will continue to reserve my own judgment on until i see the work i hope rexlex post give some to chew on however i do now be to point out the issue need to be show for to be conclude in this if the rexlex post these issue so much the better if not you will why the problem be b deyoung write in this study coin the term derive it from the lxx of lev cf use it for it be only minor point but let me it de young his own prior in this the of these issue concern with not with i doubt this will much on the such but think i should point it out from the the hypothesis de young be be coin the word b his intend for it in reference to the the question i wish to how would one go confirm the truth of this hypothesis follow if one or for the of the discussion it be correct note b be independent of i consider b more which seem merely to be counsel of over find nothing in the with to this word so i know doe not in invent word else in his letter unless you of it be not sound methodology to it if he give no hint in the immedi text to fix the for his yet the present no evidence do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis which i should the outset i find i know of nothing which it impossible of construe this problem i go to set for the moment the question of whether might coin this to look the more question of it for this there in principle two kind of evidence be be we look the text of letter for or look outside to prior or write might rely on or to write some of to the single worst problem with this word in be there be no evidence for he us the word without or hint to his it inclusion in list of imply it for him some we leave the only clue with the etymology or of the word which be indeed the de young others before him it with the leviticus prohibition of men verbing with other men where verb be some euphemism for sex lie in leviticus bed in greek one problem be bedder be not i know use in greek therefore i offer one serious test which de young hypothesis must or be reject o find body of greek text with or not much prior to his such the imply men who sex with x obviously the best be to find such of itself such text would be the word be it be worth compound word not in under by project the by the of the root existence of such doe prove the hypothesis correct but it go long such whether or not with in the specific of x n possible of comprehension by his my test move in the direction of evidence if doe not in his text his word he doe not then he to expect his to know the word which it be or to expect it mimic word they do know such they guess his without too much flounder evidence be text other own or might be then come into the picture if there other us of the word not dependent on which sufficient evidence or some gloss by scribe to show reference to homosexu or use in then one grind for o deny coin the word o his might his do you see the problem if coin the word then he require his to enough context with him to comprehend his it intent in this they would de young guess him to be refer to the prohibition of sex this mind you in context where to other so one to the how else to cor the to be pull from overinterpreting their freedom the non of to his gentile convert the it for to coin the word it first element be n be old or ionic form of in even let koine time would be n to me this imply we even more needful of evidence to pin down be do invent word in obsolete if he coin the word but pick it up like the others in his list common term of then his will be for his by common since he give no other i not enough doe not tell u he by this word we his guess they context use this very word it in to them in person but we no of evidence of to suppose it be mere so we in need of evidence this word it seem to be be precisely the problem i think of more or le hypothesis the word it gutter term of for some or very specific very b it term of use by jew the greek which or not be consciously on their with the leviticus c invent the term there or not be with leviticus in his do so he or not intend the word to explicit with since none of his other word in list such this seem to me the of the hypothesis i of these i off the top of my be most but i still too if the word never before in us some evidence of depend on then one opt for coin it if it doe before him he might still coin it be of prior use in which his be inherently confuse but one should demote c on the of us if they be show to be common in the in either of the or b one to into to the community of he pick the word up from whether it be from the greek or jewish community there be so i yet see little or no evidence to u in select one of these or some other hypothesis your guess be good mine or worse or better depend on lot of thing but it so guesswork i do know you but i for one will not guesswork with the will of god by be convince in your own conscience be get he elsewhere on in his controversy of this hold on to your own belief between yourself god consider the who his decision without go his conscience but who in of doubt be condemn he be not in good every do in be sin for my i not see to resolve in the use of without directly evidence by the of such evidence it will never to of own intent like humpty dumpty me the rest of u will use word in choice sometimes his if you to god it be bless if it should some of word lead some people then intense effort to contrive his in our soul some consequence i find to be guide if i him in the if i see him out his position in it home time time i much le his in his brief cryptic such this one in my discursive i go on length the first of my intend point would be need to confirm coin or b in the word to the the leviticus prohibition my second point be to this hypo thesis follow up it imply for both his for give my verbosity this will be tomorrow night l siemon i you god son of the ml most high of you nevertheless or you die like men ml like prince
