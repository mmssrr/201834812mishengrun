from johnh john subject re help in stephen ise write could someone tell me if decoder be the to demultiplexer i know how to link of these to get output circuit but how do i link of these to multiplexer sorry if this seem like question but i only newbie to electronics i to do this circuit droolproof possible of decoder need not be the to demultiplexer ssi you to use one such strictly of decoder need only two line in one output to the input demux on the other us two control input to determine which of four output will reflect the of the input so there three input require decoder be use demux if it be equip with output input since this be use the input when high output high when low only the select by control input output will be low eight decoder be by use the high order bite bite to select which of two four demuxes be thus you your of only one output of eight reflect the input bite note this method not be use to true eight demux since you no input the line on four decoder leave once you commit the line to their intend purpose sixteen decoder obviously require four decoder plus to only one of the four time therefore use the fifth decoder to the two high order bite to provide the four line of course the two low order bite must be connect in to the four decoder give me the credit when you submit your homework johnh electronics school of mpce university sydney johnh ph
