from jgd john de subject re do site cool tower do john write however you leave off one why do you see them but not fossil fuel it be prefer to run the close cycle fossil fuel in some get with dump the hot i the be hot in fossil fuel of course there be le of the you do see so cool tower fossil fossil unit multiple unit per mwe seem to be very when fossil be build the be mwe fossil be when be why those old dirt burner let go power cool tower low enough to the grind to be not visible from off-site quite with fossil fossil use to get much le fossil fuel run hotter the there gripe in the industry power us technology so it more in to get the cold end of the system cold possible hence big cool tower oil fire condenser but they to get the into hot not most of the down to some do cool the condenser with one pollution de-ice river up here we view resource the condense environment be the for of the issue the of where the come from condenser run high possible in order to reduce on the turbine the condenser pressure be pressure the condense it be the be free of droplet moisture in the severe erosion to the turbine low pressure move high velocity erosion of the condenser tube the coldest thus lowest pressure condense environment be the best issue be of pump the from the hotwell where the end up drip off the condenser tube since the condenser be very low pressure the only force drive the into the hotwell pump be if the be too hot or the be too low the will into bubble the pump to this be destructive form of be to be cost the hotwell pump in the lowest point in the in order to provide to the pump how much lower they must be be function of how hot the be to get in the hotwell hotwell run between degree depend on the of the river this term be use to describe the river even when the cool tower system be in close loop mode no river be pump when the river be high in the summer will the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more there be involve since higher hotwell level will onto the condense tube reduce the condenser in the elsewhere where moisture exist in the the river will be cooler the from the cool tower the of the from the cool tower be set by the humidity it be very in the to of river exceed degree difference from the degree humidity we see routinely in the it be not where the be successful in rigid limit on for the to to reduce the fire when the get too high the condenser not the without excessive pressure everybody run closed-cycle boiler the use be purify of solid which otherwise crud up the boiler plumb when the boil purify for boiler use be bigger job cool it so the boiler be recycle true the electricity fee to the boiler chemistry be the stepchild until recently not get the respect it deserve the chemist just in the or so fully understand the cost of impure by impure i with few micromho of conductivity few ppm of dissolve oxygen be now the most pure one will find outside the john john de interest in high mobility engineer tm interest in high tech computer send ur to jgd perform for free lee where when we need
