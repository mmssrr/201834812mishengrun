from subject re in write i think the first so here go post some more on to my poor one i leave the in the the be they be leave in their they need to be one in the rid lux one in motorcycle the in the rid old one of the cycle new one old upon spring time i discover of the be need to be they work properly except for the older one they to be through the summer they be store in the i think i remember my them in spring i decide to bring them in to the which two one be dirt brick the other be concrete i bring in three discover in the spring not only be the but when i put the on them the hmmmmmmmm the in other word it pin the circut trip i go on to the other they be the we still i decide to put the on them these be sit for on the brick dirt notice they only need hour or so on trickle i test them by use them the for give jump they work fine for of this me to believe one of thing i buy tty true the concrete something to do with the of the there enough moisture to short out the in the room where the concrete be the dirt room to the moisture in the better concrete btw i in the dirt room other could be the be possible the cell energy electricity with the follow pb iv oxide sulfuric produce the of c f of the compound of compound c pb the of c be therefore per mole produce note be not very soluble per c it will thus out of solution where the be occur or the positive of the i sure it be the positive where the form but i be wrong oh well i do corrode to i do feel like think through it right now be to notice here be the you know it would be be exothermic or energy if moisture with dissolve electrolyte condense on the conductive between the form this will the the proceed the be reversible if electricity from or be put into the must in composition to cell the for the the post of the there to remove or electric energy during or the be exothermic it tendency to though quite slowly under so while keep the dry be good it be not solution to why do indeed when store on concrete oppose to wood or dirt one should principle which be subject to some stress will to move to more position here the conductivity of some select conductivity c f btu hr-ft-ft to powder density concrete cinder stone dry pine to note the conductivity for dirt go down with c be k the for powder on the order of the conductivity of concrete be of of dirt be time wood it be these difference in conductivity the on concrete to on dirt or wood the be occur energy be be either electricity or conductivity of be btu hr-ft-ft during except for the trickle through on the this energy be mostly the higher conductivity will remove the the lower conductivity thus if you perfectly dry on but the bottom give the the on concrete will be time on dirt this be where principle come into remove energy from the exothermic will drive the further to completion if the occur room keep the require the of produce concrete be better sink dirt or wood store in the corner of pour concrete you remove energy which pull the if from the the of sulfuric to this will tend to drive the jeff white how do i get the ketchup out of my pocket protector french fry
