from subject level brightness light set for yes i know it nowhere time but i gon loose net in few week or if i lucky to post this for interest people to note bell be good if you phd good bos i neither subject light set with level of brightness version of brightness light set this set with blinker bulb string set b b modify set for level brightness string string b rtn note no mod to wire to the right of this point only one blinker be use note the blinker would not much current thru it the string bulb of the second string of bulb in with it why the use of the resistor here to current thru the blinker to up for the current shunt thru the second string while the blinker be glow the second string be not glow when the blinker go open this resistor only slight effect on the brightness of the string slightly dimmer slightly brighter or use bulb in of the resistor if you get one do not with bulb these too much current burn out the blinker you see when it work powerup string will light full brightness b will be light most of the current from the second string them not light b will open both string in series the string out to glow low brightness the other string on before to glow reduce brightness be sure to wire the splice resistor cut wire in
