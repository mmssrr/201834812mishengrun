from elliott elliott subject re in msf fulbright write i try to build synchronous i hit in my i to be to the of op from to input the most obvious i come up with be to use switch to the of the op the only switch i experience with it the i to switch which go from to the be only for positive i which between i to input by feed the input thru with of when the be thru with of when the be the output be then low filter i believe this be lock in detection well synchronous look the this be triple multiplexer with positive power supply be run from single-ended supply well with supply the logic input still from grind volt to vdd this be well i think so design for input output control x switch gnd resistor when the switch be close the be with the switch open it be you up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurt the this would show up feed-through for high frequency the of the might problem if it be it be elliott dsc optilink uunet optilink elliott or elliott i use to think i indecisive but now i not so sure
