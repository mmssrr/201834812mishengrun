from subject re long ir detection in cstrockb strockbine write could for some interest light sound could be control directly by the position of on or by the number of on you could even build spotlight follow the on you tell u more you do sound like very cool ti only in my eye this point i yet to choose method the requirement to design system to in one of eight the i do some experiment with pyroelectric detector find them difficult to to get definite still so their ir go the good thing pryoelectrics be their be to the of the body or body the velocity of body this could be useful for detect the intensity of gesture to little box on their body but they need to be emit some kind of to be the current toy i be work with be for the use with live video this work with video on the you set threshold for within the field of view object brighter the threshold will trigger event event be midi object or sequence sound or object it be fun to with but the be the be noisy still it very the do to you ots of s it midi which be use to control light i do to build electronics it do with light video brightness i yet to do useful or but i hope
