from jott john ott subject re pinout need for in write i recently pick up some chip but i find on them it seem they no longer by ti i do old enough book it to lead of show one hex digit it be in pin dip but pin not present if you on this pinout power requirments function send me you inc division we here only to the wind pin function lead supply input b input leave point strobe input omit common gnd input omit right point omit input d input c logic supply strobe input pin when low the in the follow the on the input when high the in the will not if the be then restore while the input be high the previous will be input pin when high the be of the level of the other input when low be determine by the in the the input be pulse for intensity input pin on these input enter into the when the input be low the weight of these input b c d point pin these lead not connect to the logic chip if point be use resistor or other current limit must be connect in series with it lead supply pin this connection permit the user to on vcc current by use lead supply or it be connect to the logic supply vcc logic supply vcc pin vcc connection for the logic chip common grind pin this be the for logic lead current except for the point john jott
