from dtmedin medin subject re suggestion on in billq billy quinn write i build little project use the to switch i get pretty when the thing switch i do most of the common thing one be suppose to do when use nothing seem to get rid of the click my question be be there good circuit i use for switch so there will be no noise of kind on the line i will or reference to etc for the will help the first step be to sure there be no dc component or not on the line to be switch if neither the output or input present dc level let they couple then put k resistor from input to grind from the output to grind be good in couple present dc level be to click if the device present dc level be from more just couple then you need to remove the dc before switch with couple of your own if you more one switch one input through to common output you use switch where for brief both source connect during switch this the switch click switch be clickless be by light bulb your own with light-dependent resistor ldr inside piece of console use this older but time-honored technique complete like this but i do number ldr you might to try for simple solid clickless switch be you might try look the switch be commonly or it older predecessor the the dc component must be remove prior to switch other include jfet switch both discrete ic diode switch which work well surprisingly the with their tip could subject for solid switch induce click of their own when turn on due to be inject into the line through device when the control technique to this include lower the of the through the switch switch slow the risetime of the control pulse with the cut the click be simple put resistor in series with the control pin hope this help get you medin phone w ssd network h corp internet dtmedin huntsville uucp uunet ingr dtmedin everywhere you look my office the opinion express here mine or those of my
