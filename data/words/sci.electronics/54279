from subject re the cell energy electricity with the follow pb iv oxide sulfuric produce of delete the of c be therefore per mole produce note be not very soluble per c it will thus out of solution where the be occur or the positive of the i sure it be the positive where the form but i be wrong oh well i do corrode to i do feel like think through it right now the problem with this be the in solution be soluble in solution will not out be in solution thus the of of for the most be to notice here be the you know it would be be exothermic or energy it turn out the be indeed exothermic produce more this to the completely useless be this we of course the slowly self this two thing the level of pb ion in the solution the oxide dissolve the level of ion in the solution the solution become le or more like if you like now the post to which i respond correctly will in solution when the dy be fully we end up with high of pb in so form in the solution to the bottom of the of course this in degree the more the more form the form conductive on the bottom of the if there be enough of the oxide leave to touch the more common in newer short result i see product in shop to correct this condition but they for the most useless they dissolve the but not restore the oxide properly you some success with these product for newer stuff delete to why do indeed when store on concrete oppose to wood or dirt one should principle which be subject to some stress will to move to more position here the conductivity of some select stuff delete this be where principle come into remove energy from the exothermic will drive the further to completion if the occur room keep the require the of produce concrete be better sink dirt or wood store in the corner of pour concrete you remove energy which pull the this stuff be just up by the be completely in the higher higher consequence of the be this if you your to lower the to to the we know from experience those of u in do it get cold up here this be not true if we to our on cold we the besides which there be not enough energy through self to the the would such whether the bottom of the or not this be of course since you would the to be cool during just keep the in cool dry keep it
