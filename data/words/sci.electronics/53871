from elton ding subject re ir sensor spec in johnr john t write doe know the of the wire din for the ir remote sensor wire ir for the the number the cursory of the connector the connector pin din provide view from connector front pin v pin v pin grind pin v-pp drive pin to drive lead drive through resistor v-pp i the connector mini-plugs drive the ir lead directly true fill in the here the scoop when you get your home brew receiver work would you be will to it with the rest of u i to build my own but never the time to fool design it pin grind pin pin hot volt pin volt hot only when be turn on pin connector the on the of the not connect to inside the except the pin connector pin there be ohm resistor between the two with from pin to grind the pin in the be sum with the build in ir receiver they use chip bjt to the i would the would be to this circuit use it the receiver if you need more info let me know
