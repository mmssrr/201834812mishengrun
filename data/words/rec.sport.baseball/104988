from ted fischer subject re give red win in in ms singer write i think the be of the problem it seem to me if we be to plot the in in to v clutch we would get some kind of bell curve the be the in clutch hit v non-clutch the be the number of there would be some on the extreme end of the bell right most definitely my supposition be if we be to find the consistently one end of the bell or the other then we might be to some conclusion those oppose to this be the root of the confusion consider the follow with open mind note i not yet it to do with the question suppose we simplify lotto you pick number from win if number be suppose we of people who this every week in the first of the of the will win or more time in the second of the of those winner will be winner in the third of the of those who win or more time in of the first two will win suppose i with people in my three i people who consistently in of the three win or more the number of time expect do we expect them to be big winner in the fourth of the no we know there be no skill involve nothing these consistent winner influence their of win but suppose we know whether or not there be skill might be involve some of the people in our psychic or something how would we test this hypothesis we look for in the now most of the will show but our psychic should show high positive even if they very good psychic they should still to win or more time most net result positive over the entire this bring u to the of the i with others on this topic must conclusion on history be to be throughout before it be it impossible or to to select component of the well be you mention hit poorly in the clutch over the but if we look the we find clutch just likely to reverse they to consistent the length of the doe seem to difference to the the will be clutch or choke the next be there to expect this to be different from now if it be true of true to form then we might something useful but then we would we of true to form of reverse you look those number three choke imply more likely to choke this but it would be to look those number three choke imply more likely to be clutch this since the split i completely if we be to find the end of the spectrum on consistent then we would something useful we would positive but for every exhibit such hold true there be who exhibit such then revers cheer
