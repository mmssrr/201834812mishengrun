subject re eck v rickey re rickey whine from smith smith in genetic m write i of the followup to this but i think i go to the to specific comment the method john he the by record in computer form for every for the he devise which i write computer to every contribution use it it work like this look every in every in be determine by inning score where the how out there for count how time the win the the occur in divide by the number of time the up to come up with for this first do by george lindsey in the report in of in george r lindsey issue volume pp pete do the thing use to set of to the kind of other people worry he report this in with john thorn skoog modify the method bite do some work on he on these his be directly on run though not on win these result to the be report in one of the bill book help me out here somebody for might be inning score runner on second no out there be with the rockies there will be more this this up in of those the win of them then the of this be description of method look in win on the plus the by time he get now for sum up his for the to for obviously the sum of for for the whole will be only you credit x to the x to the pitcher there no involve ok there very big problem here nobody yet comment on you do run you the run down into how run joe contribute plus how run fred contribute etc but do work if bob his of win by in of doe not bob his of win by in it doe the unit screwy i john be the effort will result in more win then loss while you correct doe not more win then loss it something i would who my of win by in of then i would who my of win by in of thus there to me to be obvious positive between john win thus before you this it to me further study must go into sort of there be consider bob hit solo hr in the bottom of the first on your he doe the thing in the fourth with the score tie for in the seventh with the score tie for in the ninth to win the by score of for of bob hit solo hr in credit by your method with but doe bob responsible for the win not the defense be responsible if you include pitch in bob pitch in bob only of the offense which be lot but not even close to furthermore the other run they on solo hr by fred then fred hit hr to tie up the which just hr to the see lindsey fred will himself good or so so fred bob combine of win in one there problem here the only problem here be these number how win the first we use over them to one second remember some from the of you win be who get out get in most thus i not sure in give when you up the number for who win they will up to in sometimes they will up to more then one sometime le one the pitcher give up run give them for pull night would give greg think the right thing but his intuition be off the closer enormously the number of run be outweigh by when they come or prevent from comming the double which greg be not enough in i propose test of this we predict record quite by look how run they score without to when those run score in the if run more run then look only run should to better predictor right no but only you i would think however the number of run you score in the first inning would be just good prediction how run you score in the inning something else closer come in in close not blow out it be to run closer give up in to those give up in the first inning look closer give up run often will lose on the other who give up run often still his to win the offence more out to do something but i not inning either if i down run in the ninth it doe not how run my pitcher give up in the ninth here think experiment this method to you find be point score in the first of the no no be with entire yet to furthermore the sub in off the bench who sink the win free throw with no time on the clock get for the while the who score point in the first before his get doe this sense no but why would you the of win would be before the possesion in which the free throw be look if you down point with second leave there be high you will win the if you in possesion of the do not forget somebody el miss shoot turnover foul defense etc the would win from of the discussion on this i feel those who it to extent do so out of first look this clutchness but it doe not cluthness revolve the in their others go down i never see convince proof this so if you there be no clutchness then except for lot of noice this positive to there be to get rid of the noice if you do not believe in clutchness we could find out the of home run be for we find for home run your of win by on while strikeout your of win by i bet if this be do we would find this just good other we for predict win loss how do we relief pitcher john the pitch run run k bb etc both number john however only pitch in closer while mop up who more to their john who the better pitcher they be the smith
