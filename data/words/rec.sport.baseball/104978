from subject good re for in stevet steven thornton write stuff delete score on both count he doe get to very he let lot of go through the he look smooth few error nothing this be on be mislead like lot of fielder himself look better by not he nowhere steve but not much of compliment i with the of this post but with one specific nothing it seem to me defensive be not entirely or even from his to field grounder or popups how such doe he get during fewer he get to throw from p i the of these be much higher this imply to me there be in these throw well even if they high up-the-line or in the dirt good need for such thus i do number for the number of occurences of these but i guess the of these it just like you do judge defense on how they field bunt popups but not i suppose
