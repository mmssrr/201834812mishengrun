subject re pitch from in robert write in write one to offense into with the split somewhere i give little more credit or even give of roberto of john oleruds which would be even if you do let roberto single they score lot more the oleruds by go first-to-third more often no offense gordon i would give much the effect be but there other effect well if olerud hit double runner on first will score if leg onto hit in the the runner on first need to hold third thus olerud double more of course be more likely to score hit double not to give too much to be the run work for very very slow no in the much but some others still the current run work just well in the for bill give the they use killebrew pinch runner in steal with time yet they score slightly more run predict by run we sorry but the number you be your phone degree try i for no one no one for me
