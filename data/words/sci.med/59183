from noring jon noring subject post re bloom very long post very without neglect the need for scientific rigor cross-posted to since some type will be discuss the begin note i set followup to since most of my comment more orient i sure most of the reply if will be in write i not believe the this on progress steve dyer i be word over the topic in sci med nutrition when he his reserve poster for be by licence for do not exist this reprehensible steve i see you some of the others do it here well they just respond in their hyper-choleric syndrome hcs oops be not illness in the community better not since it therefore must not never will exist it be number of will type out nt for those not with the myers-briggs system just me i send file to you in the nt comprise only of the but it be much much higher i do know the help here one drive of nt ntj be their obvious choleric driver type etc the extreme need to control to to be the best or the most competent if they extroverted they best describe field this be very in our society we need people who to to strive to overcome the element to seek thirst for knowledge to the level of competency etc the success in science technology in due to the vision n mind t of the nt of course the other type their own positive contribution well however when the nt person the of this type come out which should be obvious to who be strong nt who not to temper their will be extremely business-like of or feel be very compel to control over their the must be obedient to their prescription without question i know of this suffice to i do oblige them with followup visit no how competent i think they they very competent from knowledge viewpoint since be extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it we need more nf doctor enough on this subject let move on to bloom let me tell you who the these the who no how the body with it environment how be by diet could it just be i could help or jon but somebody else do you help me by your post of course i believe i be on the net suffer from retentivitis but be the i i just little too on few people myself in post let try to the level of this discussion the level of effluent kind of different live in the gi system mouth intestine sinus on the skin these they do not in people unless the immune system be compromise they unlike the they do not produce toxin they live out their merry existence in on our body but of these will be consider if it to up residence within the body poor mucus let this be responsible for set up this in my well-described in prior post i definitely immune stress blood test show my level be very low my sinus be mess no doubt the line the be i on time in in the end even two week of ceftin do not work i confirm of chronic infection of the sinus mucus color wo get into the other symptom three very ent this i do not culture do however of the difficulty of do this right my other symptom show infection enough of this provide to help you where i when i comment my below the first question i be this fungus little into poor mucus tissue thus symptom without be consider in the sense it be sort of inbetween infection steve get upset with doctor he use for her gi problem if steve understoood doe in the body he would not or should not be doctor i concern too of the toxicity of my doctor my blood test put me on iu of for one week only then drop it down to iu for the next couple of week i receive other since of these in complex my doctor he one of those i blood test three week he then stop me on except for some in supplement sure i of me hopefully doctor will to supplement i even some supplement i for in which steve dyer good on if only second-order improvement in relief of my sinus then it be not worth such dose long-term risk liver survive if it get to lot of glucose it bloom over ride the other live with it in the sinus gi or in though i do now believe on my successful with i definitely some excessive growth of fungus unknown specie in my sinus i still to the question there be study bloom in the sinus with sinus my sinus reduce one week of no other new be implement during this time i do not gi problem before on but some for few which then go consider btw my doctor dig out one of his reference book sorry remember which one find obscure comment into the which people develop or non-serious of the sinus to sinus symptom i to dig out reference since it be to this discussion some people do develop process the mucus or skin bloom site whether this be like to the or not be my doctor test me i believe or test for response to i show strong positive question would everybody show the strong positive so this test be useless it be true grow into the mucus tissue the exceed threshold could not person who test to definitely develop symptom such mucus due to the body response i in post one doe not need to be rocket scientist or degree or in biochemistry to see the of this hypothesis btw i repost this dr ivker in his book sinus routinely give before else systemic not not good to his new chronic sinusitis if they be on four or more time in the two he out of or so well over notice some relief of sinus other symptom but it doe cure it by imply the infection be not the but he find whether or put into sinus doe not help this imply of course excessive bloom be the sinus the grow into the tissue since will not kill other by direct it be not into the blood i lot of which doe the nt who to the double-blind study or it non-issue but one to with some if you will if it only symptom be use these symptom pretty nondescript this bring up interest use by those who will deny reject of the hypothesis until the study do be if you observe or culture the bloom in the gut or sinus then there no to or even the i know they it be impossible to test for overbloom in of the body not be observe since be everywhere in the body it those who reject the hypothesis no study be do study be do but if it not up to then it be from their perspective non-study which should not even be consider i the study should be do will big to do it right however in order to convince the fund in these time to open their you to give them evidence the only evidence to compete with other be to do the study need fund be you to do of the study before you even get fund scientist i very of this for the fund project i even if dr ivker other doctor get together pool their history into compel picture the fund they would get nowhere even if they be to publish their result it be obvious from the comment by some of the doctor here be they decide excessive in the gut or sinus to symptom doe not exist be not even hypothesis so of history or compile evidence to the will never their mind not only they would oppose the need study in their mind it do issue excessive growth to diffuse symptom doe not will not not exist period kind of tough to with those who hold such viewpoint kind of remind me of lister be keep in check in most people by the in the sinus the gi mouth intestine in the which compete with it for food the immune system doe not bother itself with these unless they the mucus if they do response will be set up most not get enough from their diet of die with le they be bear with study while this low level of doe not blindness it doe the mucus system this would then be predispose for strong response bloom there other nutrient to the proper work of the sinus mucus while suffer from bloom the most common of this type of bloom be the use of spectrum which knock down different kind of in the body remove the competition for food be concern while drug to find their doctor will not use them unless there be evidence of systemic infection the toxicity of the drug doe some but if the gi or sinus be suspect to be recent use of spectrum be the smoke gun then use should be just the for recur infection in spite of mr steve dyer the evidence from study specie grow root into deep tissue to mold grow in you continue to kill the such doe but you kill which be deeper in the tissue without use systemic such or some of the older one such which more toxic not effective this be why be point out by recent study send to me by doctor i be in with be not effective in the long term of gi it like try to weed by cut off the grind but the root to come out once you the question be whether bloom grow into tissue through the mucus some type of symptom in susceptible people without become systemic in the sense of the word something in between strictly excessive bloom not problem the full-blown systemic infection be in the gi system the region seem to be good reservoir for the use of by woman very environment the rectum for through moisture humidity of to the one of the most effctive to this be to undyed cotton if one be retentive like i be in prior post provide more site for excessive growth if the bloom occur in the the burn swell even blood think they hemorroids if the bloom to move further up the gi very diffuse occur discomfort blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood be send to her doctor in the first extensive test he tell her there nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to doctor so on tell me throiugh he consider occult blood test in stool specimen to be of time money of the very number of positive bloom guy if my gut hurt me on i would it fix yes it nice to know i do colon but then be my distress when i find doctor who me get me better steve dyer him i in there in our current system it difficult or even impossible for to the do work for i go to three ent who i will just to live with my sinusitis the they do mention surgery to open up the but my be plug it would not get to the root of my condition three month of body nutrient level monitor c lentinen etc my improve to where i two before my of course skeptic would if i do nothing i would improve but view be stretch thing quite of the experience of the three ent i who i just to live with it i confident i will one could cure the i undertake one step in direction of my overuse of for the four note for those sinus problem i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention be sure to get the revise edition i often wonder with chronic gi distress or sinus problem would do the problem he tell his be non-existent syndrome dr ivker off chronic severe sinus problem his visit to ent floor him when they you just to live with it he spend try everything until he cure of chronic sinusitis he now his in his book i honestly i on the to recovery follow some of it his one to systemic the begin of if you history of overuse be prove to him time time in his own i sure if i comment to him of the belief of the hypothesis poster he would definite thing to such it work wonder for me in two to put it mildly i would not be surprise if he would they the one their to help the those doctor who this who confront by symptom could be due to the overgrowth they fit some of the profile the people identify should consider if other be remember theory two different thing you not one without the other they synergistic if doctor doe something yet produce relief in over of his should you sit up notice you ought to trust he begin why it work of why it should work i lot of doctor become so with scientific correctness they ignore the they swear to help you to do both both to be which we do see from some of the poster to this group there come point when you just to use little common sense such try good systemic such the other i one of those who the not to help so i do the thing i go to couple of doctor who outside this result i find relief would it not be better if the set up some kind of where doctor without of be sue or his license pull try unproven beyond doubt for the point where the ineffective i like to doctor tell me well i try the in this country since they do work for you i now the to use unproven technique seem to help others i promise there some risk you will to sign something you the possibly risky of these unproven i to register your the if my ent suggest this to me i would jump on this pronto of go to one of those doctor who for either or for greed be these with much risk to risk lose their license possibly to the such would keep control in the more medicine provide would be free it would be better the current system by show the of the community to the it do everything it within to help the it be the of such be number of people to try some of which seem to work like my others of which will never work true i better get off my before this post in if it become in the gut through it be use to the sinus but before this occur the mucus system need to be strengthen this be by c some of the b-complex diet survey show not get enough these the segement of the will the problem with this non-existent disorder bloom of to be to promote the proper work of the mucos some of the from by bricklin publish by press well note from my nutrition course i will be post discussion of sometime in the future with reference cite to point out the extremely role in the mucus defense system in the body why should be effective in with bloom effective be to restrict during the this be if the gi system be involve if not get glucose it not go to out grow the you then give which use for energy to over keep the in check once be return to the gut i like to see the role of complex such if steve some of the other to jump over this post fine i jump over steve in sci med nutrition he poster who seek her doctor use of for bloom in her gut people seek from newsnet should not be this those of u give of our time knowledge slug it out to our content if you your venom for me steve leave the helpless poster who timidly seek help i would problem with your soul you the venom on usenet be quite toxic unless one develop immunity to it one my self would down right from of cholericitis but my immune system my computer system be from i now kind of like be retentive it nice ring to it i very impress by how it just flow into the post truly worthy of blue or brown ribbon i might even cross-post it to hmmm professor of biochemistry of biochemistry microbiology osu college of medicine for post i hope others who this lurk in the will post their think well no their view on this subject jon noring member infj club if you die to know infj be me i send info jon noring noring jkn ip fred
