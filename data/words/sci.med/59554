from subject infection i send gordon r my post on protein c prior to post on internet courtesy somehow i to delete my post from my text file gordon r promise to send it to me but he pretty me right now so i just retype it since dig through my reference be very time consume take me for pm post i not go to cite reference gordon r them i go to include some of the from weinsier new nutrition textbook which not in my to point out i go to some support in the community diet be know to the immune system of for very very long time protein the biggest role in infection i cover the role of protein in protect you infection now i go to hit i consider to be the most nutrient in the infection be concern when discover it commonly refer to the people linus be one decide to this title from give it to c which i cover big in my opinion be get with good the nci currently numerous in progress to see if not only prevent but cure it well it role in both infection be but not quite come in two completely different form retinol retinol be the form it toxic be the form it completely nontoxic both retinol good in the gut if bile be present the liver store of your retinol dole it out for other tissue to use by retinol bind protein rbp liver should to of retinol store we bear with in our liver show of die with the or le of they be bear with if you do believe reserve like of retinol in the liver then this low reserve be not go to you but if you believe like i do the nutrient reserve then there be problem with in the the for in be re or of for it re or of diet survey show most get this of either retinol or from their diet but the nrc council go to new in the for both c c to per to per for report it kill why concern over the the set to prevent not to keep nutrient reserve full scientist in the feel the time come to move from the prevention of concept move the promotion of optimum concept since we some very good now show nutrient reserve extremely during period of stress the win new group of scientist be collect to come out with the list which lower the for nutrient move the guideline to where they be when we first in the get enough to prevent but not enough to fill the reserve we know from only of liver with reserve to i nutrient reserve to my student tell them to them in their but for only liver biopsy or will tell you how much somebody store we tell very if someone overfill his or her liver with by the serium retinol level level highly suggestive you fill your liver with it time to stop retinol the of serum retinol will be be with serum retinol level of or higher of test little brown series book this level of in blood be due to toxicity weinsier much more to toxicity doe you will see in this post between you should plenty of it time to the retinol from your diet redness of the skin loss joint i tell my student will use in their they better monitor the serum retinol level stop when there sign the liver be full you will never know if the need the you not the pool in liver but you will know when it time to stop just like in those for pm study be to fill up your liver with retinol you will never to worry toxicity the conversion of to retinol occur in both your gut your liver will slow down stop in the liver slow down in the gut when your liver be full of retinol but the source of retinol very long time to fill the liver up i see of if you in the only much you be bear with in your liver one other problem with if you deficit you will not convert much to retinol in the gut or the liver the doe this conversion require in the of retinol from the liver be dependent process so deficit will deficit even if your liver plenty of now doe do in infection protection the body us retinol for different thing vision the first to be down where you see overt us the retinol form of reproduction us the retinol form some infection protection us retinoic how do you convert retinol which your white blood cell the cell get from blood to retinoic you use one of which require c this be why try to pull the title of from c doe role in infection interferon production for but it biggest role be the conversion of retinol to retinoic if you your of c you will your of retinoic but retinoic not be convert to retinol once it form it use then lose to the body this be why the nrc group to both c most people of c think they help themselves if they do much in their liver they not their of they do themselves more good retinoic function in white blood cell to promote in the mucus it be the in promote good mucus production good cell to prevent infectious from enter the blood system the mucus be refer to the first line defense infection for retinoic be show to cell it the effect of cell promoter which cell to divide two distinct step cell promotion for cell divide the time promoter not but for lung tissue which doe not divide promoter in the process this be the why the nci so different in progress use retinol chronic infection of the mucus be not be i tell my student who into their office with of chronic infection to be work up for with the other medicine on it list of for chronic infection i drive this home in my course the college in when i the school in ou when i give cme lecture be the best test for since night vision be when liver reverves drop to of retinol the serum level of retinol be use but it doe not drop until liver reserve drop below to if they trouble see night be good screen if rule out in one study do on where serum retinol level be of the serum retinol level below more study do on serum retinol level in group of the history of high infection we will see much stonger between infection incidence low serum retinol level do weinsier to here excerpt from their book function in vision in the forrm of retinol it be for growth of tissue be require for reproduction embryonic development bone growth deficiency the of be convert to retinoic which in growth in cell but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to be to the retinol level in or serum the for content for child be to lower of deficiency or deplete body store serum level of toxic level of test useful but difficult to perform on young child tissue sensitive to deficiency revert to the skin system of more of retinol be not chronic use of over result in dry itch skin loss joint lip hyperostois bony depositis they recommend of retinol im injection in child for deficiency but do not discus for their toxic serum retinol level be very i recommend my student try in problem with chronic infection they to rule out deficit first by get rbc run or if their run it i tell them to do weinsier suggest give them the with the per toxicity should not be problem you will not to worry pull the into the office on to run serum retinol both jon find doctor who use much higher dose of the pm be use to of i do suggest my student use these high do if you to fill the liver up of be monitor the serum retinol level then you would be but my knowledge of the suggest to me for with deficit test or serum retinol will provide good improvement long c good without to worry toxicity if they to get more fine if they follow my to check the serum retinol but retinol should never be give in high dose to woman who could become since show the fetus the dose need to show this effect on the develop fetus be of retinol per will never this effect on the fetus could just of retinol supplement help yes but the effect will long time to develop my be to use retinol to fill the liver up then switch to to keep it full be one nutrient be better off leave to prescription by doctor but when we the in this newsgroup jump over me other doctor propose the use of supplement for with chronic sinus gi distress i think the most prudent option be to keep in the otc but require to provide insert to the public the of b
