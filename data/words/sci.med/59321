from rich subject resound theory i it the follow be on copy i give of some publish in instrument i would comment this other technology for the resound system develop on the of some t to different from other it to me new like the widex just us more flexible version of the of some of the spectrum more others some compression to try help out in the difference in the resound be it divide the spectrum into low high frequency split point be on the lot of vowel be find in the low frequency while the for me be in the high frequency the two then with different compression scheme which they develop new fit build on they growth of loudness this be interest fit my own experience though i think the be to be the be you exceed the minimum threshold for person with loss the deficit become progresslively le to by the time you the loud point the sensitivity curve to converge this if you just boost sound level you the high end for people with loss hence you be progressively le the get closer to the point you to boost low volume sound more high do so differently for the low high frequency of the spectrum for someone like me who be up to cps then off cliff with simple compressor do between energy in the low high frequency therefor useful high frequency of high volume of low frequency component impressive the resound with whisper speech in noise rich university of oregon eugene or
