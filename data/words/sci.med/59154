institute of of medicine the of energy office of the society the for intelligence poster session hotel session lister hill center of medicine for more ismb or purpose this the first conference on intelligent system for biology be the meet in series intend to bring together scientist who the technology of intelligence robotics compute model method to problem in biology the scope extend to or robotic system support be cognitively involve synthesis of from multiple source multiple level or in some other exhibit the emergent property of intelligent system the conference will be hold lister

intend introduction to the field for computer scientist who wish to their tool to this rich complex cover will include molecule the of the cell of genetic the of gene expression select other topic in the of structure function to current dr noordewier in both computer science biology rutgers extensive experience in in to his current work in biology introduction to intelligence for biologist dr mit corp overview of the field of intelligence will be present it to technique symbolic notion of will be discuss well select topic in such knowledge inference the intend include biologist with some but no extensive exposure to intelligence dr co-developer of technology work in the of intelligence to problem in both industry network theory in sequence dr los this will cover the most of intelligent system for biology of technique to sequence closely topic to be include the use of network to elicit both specific of sequence the of such to technique view of sequence dr of the division los long be in the use of such technique in this genetic genetic prof john university the genetic to highly problem inspire by this will cover both the the of the genetic extension well-suited to problem where the discovery of the of the solution be of the problem will be will be to to identify resource will permit to begin use the method dr consult professor of computer science this subject since be the of text in the field linguistic method in sequence prof university of shmuel pietrokovski institute to sequence on linguistic methodology in evidence these involve the of tool technique from linguistics for recognition gene prediction the of genetic structure use theory the of code in sequence sequence reflect dr who hold in both genetics computer science penn represent the of this field consider higher-order to sequence while shmuel pietrokovski study publish with prof trifinov in the of form with check out to to ismb conference j computer science university of wisconsin west street wi phone
