from fulk fulk subject re science methodology in merrill write in fulk fulk write i do think be very useful in discussion of the of science except propose definiens be better in there quite number of well-known of drive science in useful direction but the problem with hold up the or of well found methodology be you run up such unuseful direction lysenko such curiosity not guide to methodology be note before there be the distinction between method no result should be unless it be describe in sufficient to be the do indeed reproduce the result no should be unless it be present in sufficient to be follow people with the force of the logic but people try experiment pursue for sort of not just curiousities they of the history of science there couple of point to here theory of qi could become without direct of the existence of qi for of the model of physic with no direct would be need would be theory on qi predict better the the could lie forever beyond experiment long there sufficient body of the qi theory predict better other i would hold my for the triumph of qi though i do think there be even coherent theory on it much le theory better modern biology it be to qi theory would not predict some of directly verify the existence of qi science not progress in sort of sequence most experiment out interpret in pre-existing the controversy of the determine which experiment get do there be huge messy of petty the like determine which experiment which get do keep it go be the function of science result do count unless they be the whole system be sort of for the be long the test work properly could believe he like but even mitscherlich to be when you them by you get two light in opposite direction the version from lead to result this be where lysenko etc they not even produce coherent theory predict much of when their theory do predict by experiment they do not concede the point modify their theory they try to suppress the result lysenko or try to divert to other evidence they think support their position fulk university of rochester computer science fulk
