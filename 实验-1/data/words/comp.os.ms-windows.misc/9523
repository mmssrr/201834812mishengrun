from rjn robert j subject re procomm plus for window problem kentiler kent p iler write i procomm plus for do but i be consider buy the window version it get review in computer shopper i friend who connect to the unix here use it but the screen seem to problem keep up with the modem he modem on i see it trouble keep up his pcplus for do work re to do the high speed modem edition this only to window not to nt or do not run under window one of the of most current window pc be their com be seriously deficient everyone who high-speed modem pep or hst discover the problem the first time they try to file or incoming the modem overrun retry error even when the only be the or if the complete it even longer with the old modem there three for the problem the use in most pc primitive device with single-byte fifo buffer if the not flush high interrupt the next incoming overwrite the fifo the previous one be lose do be single-minded environment during keep up window window more system do interrupt often longer to service overrun much more likely under do soon you report to your vendor you lose you be you need to to more likely since there seem to be of this issue you get no useful most of the store-front source i speak with in to solve my own problem never the term do even know even your pc do or if you your or new com you still experience error overrun the microsoft window com driver do full of the window be improve in this over but i still recommend driver like which be i use not get this problem by themselves if you modem you not problem the modem of the be design to be of the of the overrun it however i would to bet the designer be clever will insist on if i ever buy modem some modem do even but if they to work with window driver they need to one use below to see the modem be or be pretend to be the the on most pc com port on semiconductor or chip or inside vlsi chip where you them you id the type on your system by run the microsoft be sure to run it in do before bring up window the window prevent msd from identify if you run it from window do prompt the receive fifo with trigger level run clock up to bps with current modem technology there no point in push your luck by go over bps the short cycle time the or the but it be not pc driver ever use this for more info see semiconductor note so component do you try to the on your mother multi-function com or modem if you find socketed component with the number or your com port bury in vlsi you wo be to perform chip if you your vlsi com port i choose to do you com if you one or more socketed or chip you buy plug-in or low power cmos version ic from supplier for to the n chip be the other style but chip without the the ok n chip bug will reportedly those of their own for free clone chip from ic other the for the turbocom driver support for the follow chip semiconductor chip technology instrument silicon system vlsi turbocom the pre western problem be report with ibm system ibm reportedly will them if you do socketed chip you need to buy com or multi-function if this be modem you be hose to new com or multi-function you need to either the port s you or them to out for irq conflict without turbocom in the interest of get the problem solve quickly i elect buy the circuit technology from jdr microdevices drive jose voice u voice other u the the be sell for it be provide port type connector irq comment com com irq in socket com ribbon com irq in socket irq ribbon the kit include ribbon connector for the com port ribbon for the port two for the connector port be the com port tx rx rts ct dtr dcd dsr jumper jdr sell m-f ide i from people le expensive m-f with tsd system for the plus per greenfield distributor voice their be they sell for r s system inc longwood fl phone for i no experience with of the firm except jdr the mct from jdr i only need two port run out of irqs on my pc so i my built-in port however with the turbocom driver below i could set the use irq the simply to will not completely solve common overrun problem the m driver do full of the the window driver even le the window driver the follow they only the receive fifo only bps they never the fifo which result in interrupt of during they set the trigger level byte too high it for more byte to before the driver the fifo the port menu of the control only speed up to with modem text compress or more suggest host dte connect of bps would be effective the wo the wo let do know there be there even if it do do get little benefit from port with the driver they do irq for the bios doe properly in system window provide no for do provide port speed option bps these problem reportedly not solve in window nt or do or not be in window but before rumor suggest they be solve in window you get driver solve of those problem by buy copy of turbocom current version from bio-engineering division hill or voice bb compuserve price i bio-eng be not set up to credit so i to send check list turbocom but i know they do stock it bio be not per se they need hi-speed connection for in-house instrument write their own driver discover for it revise it to be purpose com driver suite they recently it for window it be run-time license i now my host dte connect set to bps most of my i problem with i routinely see exceed bps i use bps when link to my pc with lossless to remote system host still use driver note be still the highest the window port menu in control will in configure com port turbocom get this by you to specify on port will set the to multiple of the through the window box i flow control i suggest you do the even if you only ever be not sufficiently method of flow control the dec for hysteresis be the sender yes sixteen byte receipt of the xoff from the receive system or device the byte fifo in the be not big enough to let u rely exclusively on well-respected engineer inform me the do by itself in the environment so use still be risky even with flow control with turbocom still experience overrun in very busy system with lot of run serious in progress if this be your you need to buy co-processed com but this will cost you more review of two such review of turbocom be find in the issue of window source i suggest try first experiment with process priority time slice if you power user whose system still run into comm problem close comment the of support be the computer industry it be the oldest the job of design write often seem to be to the senior or lowest engineer computer the design of the port be ten behind the of the in my job with vendor i lobby for improve port when they be do the design of new system of subsequently introduce with port however this be the exception few computer seem to for decent you well you this show no sign of improve soon when i expect cry of from window user world-wide whose pc sort of work with but will with without like the without driver use to best modem will be of money bob suite internet rjn fort
