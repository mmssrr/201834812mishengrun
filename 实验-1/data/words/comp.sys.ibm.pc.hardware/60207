from subject re problem with scsi jumbo drive ron write i just my exist dtc scsi controller with now trouble restore from jumbo drive here document i write some time it slightly now do be but much of it be still useful internet this be the opinion doe not constitute the support opinion or policy of or of the little green men be follow him id rel hint tip for the scsi this document hint tip for get the scsi to work with they upon my experience with controller will hopefully help others however note i not the follow will help you it work for me the in this document could possibly you to lose some or of your file on your disk up the entire content of your disk before try upon in this document copyright by this document be freely copy for use only not be reprint in for-profit without the consent of the note i no connection with other customer topic cover in this document window mode device sound info note of this document sometimes terse description of problem for reference support bb send comment correction etc to me compuserve internet window mode the window should configure do window for use with the however just in something go wrong i go to describe some of the need to get window work with the you notice window your pc run much slower even when you not run window method of speed it up discuss in the section window run slowly msdos the window the disk to your file if you follow the instruction you notice you need to use double-buffering with this be the setup you notice your system run much much slower in both window msdos see the section window run slowly for some of speed your system up window to get the to work with window sure the section of the file the entry i believe the window this entry to but i not sure if this doe work for you you might to try some more line you do need the line though the entry be use to support for memory like only need if you use such window run slowly once you do get window run with the your system be run much slower before if it not it you to be use version in your file this to be win solution you very lucky whether your luck will hold out to be see if your system be run much slower before this be definitely by with double-buffering to the window the microsoft note double buffer require with you must use with double-buffering while this work it slow down your pc i once this slow my pc down by of five i consider this i look for other solution you not just double-buffering if you do window in mode will not work you might even destroy the content of your disk by try to run window you do be one of the follow use other driver provide double-buffering it be my opinion the slowness in be either by horribly inefficient double-buffering or by bug in use driver provide vd service vd for service this be which be support by window disk controller like the to work with window my disk countless time i find the follow solution none of which require use note however i now get error which not by these solution but might be see below while the follow doe not require use some kind of disk utility be strongly recommend this window run much much if you do not the driver or you do not need function for control cdrom drive more two disk etc you the driver to your file window need the option this driver must be into low memory it not be into high memory it occupy of november the driver could be from the bb hopefully it still there if you need function the driver version or you use both the driver in your file enough the driver be high you do i would think this would my system but it doe i support this they high should be fine long be low on my system not use with would window to upon or exit window with the result of corrupt disk some of my c file would be corrupt for me these occur while different from the window shell this be the be i no if be with version of note people use or without they do not seem to problem i consider these people lucky others like me sort of problem in my opinion the best but not the solution be to to the driver be no longer need while you could get previous from the bb the driver be not from the bb i know there only three to get copy you buy the new of november scsi driver kit which supposedly include well other driver such cdrom driver i believe the list price be if you copy of older version of you supposedly to it to scsi for copy of be include in point pc tool for msdos note the driver store in different directory note further only be include the cdrom driver driver to support more two disk not include this be where i my copy of note however i now get error with window in defective in my pc be this i my just i find the solution however these error occur only during disk there be very but definite possibility the error for the bus time for disk might this i run memory test for hour time these test find no problem this problem be by memory with time requirement which error during disk this be why the memory test do find problem the problem show up only under disk however i mention this just in it be problem device there two possible problem with use the with device such the memory system jumbo very long time the drive stop stop etc be or encounter too error this problem might be by defective on my however i of other people problem so i mention this just in it be not problem on my long time if you device you to the bus time for best result when use the drive while do or restore the drive motor should be continuously run with only however the bus time on the the drive motor to stop stop every few second this needle to the drive however note dirty or defective drive this sure your this the or restore to much much longer the problem here be these use the floppy to in memory the drive the us to in memory the disk the floppy need to fee to the drive if the drive be not feed quickly enough by the floppy the drive stop rewinds bite once enough be feed to it the bus time on the which be time be too for when be do to be from disk to memory then from memory to the the time on the hog the memory too much too much time be spend from disk to memory not enough time be spend from memory to the drive result the drive stop be not feed to it quickly enough the solution be to the bus time the set be microsecond on microsecond off the bus on time need to be lower to microsecond this be do in one of two if you you use the n option for i use bus on time of microsecond which i use the follow line in my file note there be no between the n the if you do your only recourse be to try to find which be very difficult to find the be for of their own doe not seem to this widely distribute i once someone who work for they me to not it if you ftp to the internet you could try use to hunt down copy i believe there couple of site it if you do find copy you run it like so setscsi this the bus on time to microsecond run without reset the bus time to the note it seem you not use if you use my system if i could use with however do not lower the bus on time below microsecond or it microsecond if you lower it too low the disk throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower for me microsecond work fine this work fine for you or you to it little once you lower the bus on time restore should run do not experiment with the bus time with the other option i not describe unless you know you do error worse by memory refresh exist on the bb unless this be since i check which be while this be file couple of other file this file suppose to one to set the bus time for the others however when i try run this with my my system the time i run i do check to see if there conflict with it this old work only with the the doc it work with the or too error this problem or not exist it exist on my system problem just on my could it however i of other people problem so i mention this just in it be problem just on my symptom of this problem which persist even the up to encounter sector detect error result in work but the the drive stop stop etc much too often unlike the problem long time where the drive stop every few second this kind of occur every few second or so plus doe not device other like point the cm jumbo you cm jumbo drive the drive but plus not too error i do not know be this problem i discover use different floppy controller solve it few month i my which floppy controller i floppy controller on the i the floppy controller while i decide to try the floppy controller use the one on the when i do this the drive cm jumbo plus suddenly to find use the drive i do know if this by problem on my on the one the floppy drive work when they be to the which seem to there nothing wrong with the on the other the drive do work well to the floppy controller but it do work when to different controller this could be of problem on my i do floppy drive so it be the problem in the i do know the be however if you problem you might to consider try new floppy controller sound sound or record sound this be do use like the drive the conflict with the sound unlike of the this conflict itself error your system with error be be be so quickly by the sound the memory refresh not occur quickly enough which error get error there be problem with your system in this however the error be not symptom of i find such error occur while record sound the of such error you the record fidelity higher record in stereo record use of etc like the drive solution the solution here be to lower the bus on time see the section on drive for on how this be do note however this or not solve the problem it only reduce the of error the use to record sound this problem some be inefficient disk the speed of your disk the of disk this info this section hint tip rumor much of it be merely i or not verify i believe the follow be correct but i not sure use it your own risk with qemm you need to specify the db unless you use the driver if you do qemm will bootup the qemm mention this the doe not seem to detect be present this option to the qemm line this occur with the qemm i test other version version of qemm need this but i not sure i never use version if you use you do not need to give qemm the db some or version of the do not support disk over one in to support disk with over you need to get new rom bios from i not sure if this be still true of the be sell by to connect cdrom drive to the you need scsi cdrom drive some driver note some cdrom drive non-scsi these drive not be use with the you three choice for cdrom driver i no how well the follow solution work or even if they work the follow be you buy scsi driver which list for something like if you older driver you supposedly to scsi for for the scsi supposedly everything you need you buy the corelscsi driver which be by the people this cdrom driver scsi driver worm driver etc i do not know the list price but i see this sell for note corelscsi doe not come with the driver which be need if you do not you be better off get scsi this method be obsolete the follow driver be obsoleted by scsi kit but i mention it in someone these driver you use the driver in the kit the kit cdrom driver you will to get copy of high-level cdrom driver if it be not include in the kit but this be from bulletin to use scsi drive with the you need know how to to scsi drive i like the section on cdrom drive i no how well the follow solution work or even if they work the follow be point pc tool for msdos supposedly support number of scsi drive it come with scsi driver well point the corelscsi driver scsi see the section on cdrom drive for more however note corelscsi doe not come with but require i see sell the in three scsi controller with disk rom bios scsi controller driver scsi controller driver corelscsi i now sell the in fourth scsi controller scsi driver include driver those people who use unix might be interest in version of gnu for msdos to scsi drive the driver you need this driver before you use this i never use this version of gnu but i it work i do know how well though if you ftp to the internet copy be find on mirror site gnu for scsi drive for to gnu src for gnu for scsi ctrlr i no if copy be find on compuserve unixforum might it if forum doe msdos be concern the the controller the with msdos the should work well the however the for these two be not there be one non-msdos do not work with but do work with version of bsd unix in curious here edit copy of my file d on rom st m umb shell c p note i use qemm if i be use or i to use look like d on rom st m umb shell c p if i be use i use something look like on rom st m umb shell c p however if i use drive or if i to record sound from sound i would still need some of the bus time the first two version of of this but this version doe fill-column nil end
