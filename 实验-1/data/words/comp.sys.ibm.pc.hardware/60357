from greg subject re ide v scsi smith wlsmith write in bgrubb grubb write point of view why doe scsi when it come to multi be it could be on the drive scsi find it it get it off the drive into the computer doe it better system i think scsi good bus when multiple device if we only single drive why scsi be inherently from drive ide device electronics currently the most common be use for medium drive more one drive why do you with the spec-sheet of the bus first you quote scsi spec till you blue in the but if they exceed the bus then the point who or vlb the only worth invest of new pc worth of money in who ide be limit to vlb-ide doe know how they perform you do to vlb-ide us the connection ide if be limit by ide whether it to or vlb not so it lowest set in mode the through put of ide in mode in full mode it blow poor ide out the window down the street into the implimented on system on mine for one thing scsi blow ide out of the down if ide better throughput why be it use on file server the problem become the drive keep up with those through put be where the bottleneck cost of come from not the itself but more more from drive to use the through put give the question scsi use only single drive controller be it then to get scsi drive will do for the scsi choice to sence doe meg scsi drive cost no the nice thing on o scsi use both drive once i get unix on one of my pc with windogs the o only use one of the two ide drive one time it pretty ugly i just buy for my home i for it i see ide drive the in i think the or scsi stand in not come down in price we pc not sun or or sgi or your unix be million of pc buy decision over the scsi plenty of time to come down in price no we scsi be expensive simply nobody do common for the pc if they common implement method of scsi to pc like in sun or then you find scsi the connection medium of choice i wo the scsi for good well implimented but i still to know why it better ide on bus when it come to o when from single scsi drive on single drive scsi be more expensive but you buy your pc for so you to more drive or the follow why i find scsi better ide list you different type of device them concurrently scsi device work on different i pc home move drive between them be very nice with scsi hook them up they go scsi device work together better ide device for recently i older connor meg ide to meg ide the connor must be setup the it will work no other on scsi you set the check the plug it in it go i problem with ide exclusion i notice the time it to switch from drive c to drive d be quite long to the time it to switch from drive c to d on scsi system under o this be very thing be go on once one thing i notice fringe benefit be the to older drive on scsi system with little problem we get bunch of meg drive i to my pc i now get the full but it doe me to meg drive meg drive drive meg drive on the simply put scsi be ide no mysterious jumper to figure out greg you go when you do greg go it of too love rocket uunet csn
