from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi richk krehbiel write stuff the connection between ide clock bite width if ide speed come from where doe the sight for ide come from scsi be not complex it be just the the industry us it there three key difference in scsi the controller chip the port the be it let u look scsi in from this point synchronous mode scsi driver only be slower then synchronous mode only v synchronous speed be by most divices with rewrite of the driver be the for the this be the source for the confusion this differ from only in the controler chip in most in the some pc this be it us port driver produce speed through inspite of this even in the slower mode speed in mode with see in both higher end pc synchronous mode just higher burst two wide require two thing over driver wide scsi port on the the device require two thing over driver the recieving devise support speed of both be the with burst know wide scsi over this require driver wide port the recieving device mode chip expect this be very expencive speed with burst i simple seven version of scsi by the controler chip the port the it drop to only five version of scsi by only the chip the port
