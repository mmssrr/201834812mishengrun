from bgrubb grubb subject re ide v scsi write we device hd on controller or we controller chip use the chip be on controller we device hd on controller here be rewrite of my info sheet scsi section scsi only device common to both ibm the use of device drive printer nubus plus only some monitor cd-rom scsi be synchronous scsi be difference between these mode be in the driver problem there lot of device which which problem for more then two devise off the scsi port scsi be suppose to be only the begin end other set up problem for either or ibm device per scsi controller synchronous be often for version of see for fully mode device per scsi controller be implimented very since it run use driver which limit it to device which result in it sometimes be consitered of require different port electronics scsi driver from which them more expensive other scsi scsi seem to run only in synchronous mode hence term scsi speed with burst with burst with burst be the biggest due to the it be the only i know of pump speed through device controlers it be on the though you do see for throughput for pc since doe not need the include electonics of it be the cheepest of the just pop out the electornics pop in electronics some people consider where i use to be one of them but though put with burst of be not but be rule of thumb if it be scsin over then it be some type of scsi use of electronics which further reduce it cost to
