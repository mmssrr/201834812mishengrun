from gordon subject re how be null modem kevin kimmell computer write i interrested in the simple concept of the null modem i no so do count i be pin doe it use or it i just to solder one myself of buy one i do even know port be use help me kevin i intend to use the for pc-to-pc or telix info i do not specific knowledge of or telix but my for be to follow one instruction for the null modem the be one be different since there be for pc to pc the follow be i write up will give you null modem but you should still check your i will couple of of be for between computer modem it be between end system the terminology use be equipment dte equipment dce spell out the level the connector type the pinouts the protocol the connector be but ibm set of the td recieve rd grind sg there other provide control between the dte the dce for the dte it be power up to in the dtr dtr be output on the dte input on the dce the dce it be to in the set dsr dsr be input on the dte output on the dce ok five there only four more of interest the request to send rts be output from the dte input to the dce be use to the dce permission to send if the dce it send ok the to send ct for completeness the ct be input to the dte output from the dce the other two of interest ring ri detect dcd these both input to the dte output from the dce ri be just you would expect to the dte someone be to connection to the dce this be specific to the modem telephone line setup dcd be for the dce to the connection be the dce be to some remote dce there it oh there other define but they obsolete i the nine on pc the pinouts follow sg td rd dtr dsr dcd rts ct ri now to your problem when you connect pc to pc dte to dte there be no dce in the middle therefore the definition do work out quite right there be no dce to the ct dsr dcd or ri so the common thing to do be to not use these forget the dtr rts output well if this be do you simply null modem through sg cross td rd pin of one end connect to pin the other end etc the problem with this solution be pc to send no of know if the other pc be it would to just send the hope it get through therefore better null modem would include the cross point confusion be in the just you run the wire doe not the soft will use them if you use the built-in bios to control the port then the bios wire you need how they to be use but if you comm such brooklyn bridge or link or telix then those the requirement the only thing you guess be the sg td rd the be common there be one more issue need to be here be flow control in the scenerio the dce responsible for flow control it be the dce could possible over-run the dte by this i long the dte it dtr line the dce will send without request permission first note the to the other direction of flow the dte must request permission by the rts line it must for the ct before it send now in the dte to dte scenerio the question be do you need flow control the be but how for one common technique be xon xoff which be implement in no wire to flow control the td rd the xon xoff this type of flow control be use in to flow control but the problem be you send your might include the xon or xoff code erroneous conrol work be to the insert code but the flow control be prefer the problem with flow control be there be no there lot of to do it i bet they be try one cornerstone of the method be to use the for one direction but beyond be you must look to you comm for requirement but i bet you find one if wire properly could work with of the long they of the by the i with one us for flow control the rts be request to send the dtr be to recieve the ct be the to send the dsr be the request to recieve this doe not differnt it be just the clincher to of this stuff be it be common to the directly control by the ct which the ct must be present even if you not support ing it in for these you will find short the rts to the ct the end or the dtr to the ct other possible short might be do just the expect you do or do feel like provide it would wire i the dsr short the dtr to the dsr be not good in but you find like this it be it the whole purpose one more be the dcd some include the pc bios expect to see the dcd before it will work this sometimes get short with the dtr but my null modem the rts ct short end but the rts be connect through to the other end connect to dcd of course the cross the of course the sg must through this null modem work with most the flow control if use the with the if your comm doe not specify the require for pc to pc connection then i suggest you use this one td rd rd td dtr dsr dsr dtr dcd rts rts dcd ct ct gordon
