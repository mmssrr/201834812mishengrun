prison term without either the of their or the crime of which they be ever be public by those involve in this politely refuse my request one or look the subject be too if i comment on it i will be implicitly it be true if i mention specific even hint it i might be guilty of public something which not be publish the of never for there be in it prison who be sentence to long prison term without either the of their or the crime of which they be ever be public more precisely court order on the of their on their imprisonment in of imprison without u the of this country know it not know the one person or be try throw in prison for security offense in complete secrecy in the for during the of the we the third be in prison but since then exist then no longer be find even in south country or in the former communist country but it this be still possible in of the of the knesset committee on the constitution justice mk send letter on this subject this week to the prime minister the minister of justice the the content of the letter during the number of be imprison for period for security offense in some of these impose not only on the specific of the crime for which the prisoner be convict but even on the mere of their imprisonment in those be convict the prisoner spend their term in prison without public either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner mk on the other in his letter there be no question it be possible in some it be be impose on the specific of security offense the course of but even in such the court must weigh the under which will not be hold in public however one must whether the imposition of on the mere of person on the of person sentence to prison be justify in the of the principle of public the right of the public to know not consistent with the of person from public sight his descent into the of prison thus decide to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice the request they consider the question the of be strong enough to the cost incur by by the principle of public punishment the of not be to prisoner whose detention it be keep secret write the counsel of the civil right union we the civil right union do not know of of security prisoner of who imprison whose imprisonment not be public this be which if it exist be definitely just like censorship be the union be of where of suspect to member be withhold i only of i know of where not to meet with sometimes for the whole first month of be do of the secrecy the suspect himself his his or even the in court but there where the member themselves not interest in publicity the know nothing of the so everyone be yossi of the give the they exist in where the of person for security offense be keep secret be definitely possible nothing be the court order someone who commit security offense spend long in prison without u know it do you find this definitely not we live in country such of be impermissible i well be from the of security but silence be consider the of in his we know he with sentence to in prison the hold behind close door nobody know the except for those who be to it be somehow possible to though not to the but i note we of his imprisonment why be the serious we trust the discretion of the court the judge no choice but to trust the to them the judge do not the tool to this give the government enormous power power which they misuse if there be security issue i of the system not security expert in opposition to security i believe it be possible to the of the the without enter into we see how the concern be misuse in the of the heller murder suspect in the murder hold for month without the be public on the other belief security be for prohibit of suspect or of convict imprisonment definitely not but i of the mere be to security different opinion be express by uri former for to prime minister levi eshkol meir we of such with the principle proceed must be hold in public no doubt this the principle of freedom of expression definitely to the principle of freedom which be by the prohibition of nevertheless the for the possibility of such to where the possible consequence of be which follow from of the principle i mention the to decide such of doe not rest with the prime minister or the security service but with the court which we rest will only if it be convince of it need beyond of doubt nevertheless rule such phenomenon be such extreme step must be only in the most extreme tv me do it
