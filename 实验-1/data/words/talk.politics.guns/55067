fire-engines within mile of the compound the gun loony be fire on vehicle with of meter they be use not would be shell of this would be lot of shell sniper could screen the people try to put out the

until the fire well under before they the fire in they do even tell the fire to be on i sincerely hope the fbi reno others involve in this get the just punishment they so richly deserve someone should for this needle of life these evil sob will never justice the the government will just this incident it up be solely koresh still the people will believe them next question the problem be of course the bunch of nutter to collect huge of in the first this be not the problem the problem be we government be become more every if people decide to own gun live in one together then be their on the other if the bd be in posession of explosive gun then the government do the right to their compound but the the bd be in posession of be prove yet so i not go to conclude the bd break koresh of child but if this be his only crime then the presence of the be justify the be only suppose to with cop they should out of other kind of out of their jurisdiction better yet they should be imo the sequence of event there no option but to some sort of intervention if the fbi the for it they could mount type to the child by shoot the sound like something the s would do life child should be with respect even if they religious koresh seem to think everyone would come out sooner or the fbi nothing but time on their why do they to the this senseless their job be to protect the public life not kill people for cry out loud it no win koresh plenty of opportunity to give up for the murder of the officer he order the murder of the child do be so sure i in one of the cult member when one of the go through the it knock over which the house to be on fire this cult member koresh no intention of commit suicide koresh confirm this therefore if this be true then this the fbi murder everyone in house even if this be not true the fbi still do get off the hook they long time to the fire they these people to die in order to reject the word of the fbi it be to beleive the word of who just murder child order the of his other follower to the give the to serve upon koresh the be meet by gunfire in to murder them the supporter the shoot simply doe not up if the go there to shoot they would go with issue for purpose they be the b-d follower you wrong on be they shotgun some be with pistol but not be the which they be be simply ludicrous the b-d seige could not be to go on indefinitely the b-d be quite of commit suicide murder the child time the only other likely could objective would be very risky order of or the seige not design for defense terrorist to disloge without the siege to go on not option either besides the serious risk koresh would moment there the question of the difficulty of keep the emmergency on over prolong period the longer the siege go on the more koresh his follower would be for prolong siege go in the to go in too soon you think of better of get the child out the people who do not gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this be simply it be not enough for them to simply dismiss the government incompetent would require them to come up with solution themselves they to come up with government theory whereby the government decide to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of to them to get gun control through gun control be the only issue here if the sick little monkey in try to use the incident to gun then they will just how up they concern me much more new gun control be the government seem to be to get with like they do in they become more more people right the this disturb me it should disturb you well this theory the get of it kill the fbi etc enjoy sit out in the middle of be shoot by religious nutter still the theory be comfort it them to pretend prof nothing except how incompetent the government be in resolve crisis no govt in the world ever quite there no in which it could be resolve the doe not rest on the fbi it rest on the koresh to get so in the person who tip the b-d off in the murder of child on his or her conscience there number of people in the u who predict the end of society through security the be these the very people who pose the to society in the first the next not be religious nutter but movement splinter group of the klu klux over schoolhouse in for hold hundred child the only possible solution to such work be to prevent them no other government in the world such this be no other government so high power to become to little hitler or would be to set themselves up in their own little empire phill scott kennedy brewer before koresh be thug who interpret the bible through the of gun the be thug who interpret the constitution through the of gun me
