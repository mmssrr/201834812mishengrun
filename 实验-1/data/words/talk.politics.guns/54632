from lvc subject re need info on suicide for here something preston covey professor of ethic cmu write from preston k covey covey subject gun risk mon feb est folk from the nether world on the street by erik entitle force i felt reply in order to his of the notorious gun be time more likely to kill to protect i send the follow to the wsj gun risk preston k covey erik on quigley force wsj cite the most notorious gun in the home pioneer study of gunshot in king county find gun in the home time more likely to be use to kill it owner spouse friend or child to kill intruder the time be everywhere these it grow in lore like the myth it by one pugilistic pundit to give the shock of the find the conclusion of the new of medicine nejm study be the of keep in the home for protection must be question responsible people should indeed question the risk benefit of bring into their home but we need to know be this the risk benefit the nejm testimony be neither the whole truth the benefit nor nothing but the truth the risk further with motor vehicle we to know control do we over the risk benefit with the risk of or or how we the risk like toll the nejm be not very helpful here the nejm find purport to inform u but it be to u off it be widely in the whose very be to prejudice terrify the frightful for itself the risk outweigh the benefit yes fool would run these risk if your be time more likely to kill you love one friend or innocent child to get you to your should you not the bus put the good of in the of lie lie surely we do better where life closer look this risky business the time of the nejm study be the product of divide the number of home kill in self-defense the divisor into the number of member or kill by gun in the home the dividend the divisor of this risk be in the there be intruder other of self-defense the dividend be in the study there be homicide suicide divide by yield there be of in king county between so the study outside of home the notorious time be seriously on six count the dividend be in the the or of the study who include your friendly drug neighborhood member be to friend the be the offend gun kill only beloved member friend innocent child be but the of both victim killer to the risk these risk by the impression the toll be by witless shoot friend friendly neighbor this be the study itself doe not distinguish household or environ by people with violent or history where the risk of be very high versus household by more civil folk for people who high-risk like drug wife where the risk be very low indeed in negligent but homicide mostly by people with history of violence or people who high risk for to ignore these obvious risk in homicide be ignore the role of in by neither gun nor would occur without or vehicle but the person of the gun owner or driver the risk one of the the nejm be be the mere presence of gun in the home be much more likely to kill to protect this obscure indeed the role of responsibility the of this study unlike to the gun gun in the home be time likely to kill the center to prevent violence of the nejm us this we dispense with the silly whether people or gun the kill by gun would not occur without the gun the question beg be how would occur without the gun in people the the gun their instrument the core of the risk in gun responsibility choice due responsibility gun choice homicide suicide by gun or otherwise the choice to own gun need not condemn person to high-risk pool the gun doe not this risk by itself people lot to risk they run with gun in their home for of protection course do not run the tout time risk more skilled sober driver run the risk of or suffer do reckless or drink driver obscure the role of responsibility choice just they obscure the role of socio-economic other in this be why we resent premium consigment to risk pool whose norm our nothing consign u to the nejm risk pool but our own of choice or responsibility in the suicide for of the by gun in the home in the nejm study the by gun in king county include those outside the home in-house suicide of the toll which be closer to the roughly proportion find by other study suicide be problem of very different order from homicide or the of the nejm study be these suicide might not occur without gun it be true suicide by gun be likely to succeed it be not obviously true the of gun would prevent or of these suicide this be widely or but the of on gun suicide show otherwise this be wishful think in but few truly impulsive see bruce l et the side of homicide university press rich et gun suicide of if suicide be remove from the dividend of the nejm risk the time would to six the inclusion of suicide in the nejm risk like the or interdiction of intent itself be profoundly of the nejm study this issue of the nejm study the of homicide most like the nejm homicide on the disposition of but homicide rule rule self-defense in the on woman disposition notorious for under-representing the of or homicide cover story on woman fight report one find of woman who their murder conviction throw out july cover story on week of gun report of the domestic shoot by victim but only of the homicide be report self-defense in time report of the homicide be rule self-defense in the report of self-defense in error by of four the possibility of such error be not by of the nejm while both the dividend the product of the nejm risk the divisor be the divisor of this count only who kill not who successfully without be kill or even shoot the utility of self-defense be the other side of the coin from the do with gun in home kind of idiocy be it to this utility only in term of kill do we the utility of our police solely in term of felon kill oppose to the more who otherwise foil or deter should we not let count those where no life be lose successful defense the question pose to cite the nejm be this why neglect the compendious on successful defense by criminologist kleck point gun violence in de gruyter of the risk of defensive use on survey well other study the be high one million the risk be good gun defender better either those who resort to other form of or those who do not resist divide one million gun defense by gun from self-defense homicide suicide yield thus we construct much more the nejm gun be time more likely to be use to defend or other crime to kill of course critic belittle the dividend of this be good news for gun defender be news for gun control we should indeed question the method of high of defensive use i question the nejm the issue of how to risk be not settle by of one thing trouble me still we the unquestioned nejm in our but we ever find good work mention even
