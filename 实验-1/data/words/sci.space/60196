from fred j subject re in write in fred j write this system would produce enough energy to drive the with some leave over very high power of mw cw or cw very proton would be require but this use the biggest question would be the chemistry the on-line process of the element be quite i believe this be go to work on the one need to process when i see them put couple ton in one end get out the other end plus be to run it off it own power sound like motion doe it fred the honest thing to do would be to your criticism on scientific grind pretend you be engineer give you post i i surprise though well me for try to continue the discussion just tug my forelock in not consider try to recover the energy from this process which be try to go the on the energy curve now where do i put those i not not i so you not surprise though no it be nothing like motion note i do it motion or even it sound like motion the sound like motion which i consider different propposition the one you elect to i should beg your for be too precise in my use of the physic be well understand the energy come from fission of in folk since the pulse neutron source in use tool design be improve with superconducting which help los expertise in high current so i believe they know they i will believe this process come even close to economic give the mix of the will to be run through it oppose to the cost of thing first different for when i see them dump few ton in one end pull out the other once the cost risk etc into i still this one with the of throw into the sun sure it possible the physic well understand but be it i still wonder sort of you could get with something like this oppose to kind of energy you would recover oppose to it would cost to build power with without the energy recovery we ounce pound or ton or metric ton for you si of we week month or week month or for you si hmmm still use time i see the why breeder or not be build be there be to do so be still too of look insist on perfect be for people who do the to live in the world dryden i do for others they do for me
