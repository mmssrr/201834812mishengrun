from subject re burster where they in kwp kevin w write resolve power of the optic be different effectively just coincidence counter one on corner of the be from the time of the detector obviously not count too low rise time too long for this to be possible the cgro be meter long you need to time to of to do this doe be the strength in of the detector function of photon energy of the detector doe not isotropic response to do this right one must model the of photon in the detector even of photon off the onto the i believe they now reduce the error to degree f
