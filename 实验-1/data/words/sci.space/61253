there be some between soviet scientist on the origin of for the probe owner the wide the summit of high monte the on the the result of meteorite scientist on the other felt the proof huge sit on the northern continent of in event the decide to on verdict venus until the of their own probe schedule for in the the venus orbit voir it design the redesig the venus vrm the would be the portuguese this

sixty kilometer thirty-six mile five to twenty degree the height when the mission end in july of there be for one of the to the more southernly this do not come to the orbiter not possess enough to perform the in of the soviet institute of electronics with six hundred kilometer mile of to sort into of twenty-seven of the northern hemisphere of venus venus by for the thick of venus be tempt to scientist who wish to explore the of with instrument professor of the french centre cnes propose such only to joint french-soviet mission in nevertheless in the such would come true when two proton rocket be send on december the soviet union provide western observer with the first full view of the booster which be every soviet venus probe since this but one of first for the complex mission the probe into december be of the word be the word for not only do the more one mission to perform they more one objective to explore the comet this periodic it return to the inner region of the system since it visit in since it widely believe comet the icy from the of the system five billion scientist the world high priority to explore one of the few such body which come close to most comet linger in the cold outer fringe of the system some like perturb by force in the sun where they circle for spew out ice debris for million of kilometer from the of encounter the soviet union with the institute of science do not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in history to close of the would be use the giotto probe to close flyby of the comet while first deep pioneer suisei comet would view from much scientist in the unite desire to study the comet from the of probe one time envision vessel power by or ion engine however government budget cut to the effort the would to do with the of from other though instrument the dust counter design by university professor john simpson on the soviet mission in of the soviet to be the of build entirely new for the mission the soviet decide to modify their bus design to encounter the comet while perform venus mission the venus the bus would drop off one use the of the shroud to swing them comet much the probe use venus to flyby mercury eleven the soviet would then on to help to pinpoint the of the comet erupt nucleus for the giotto probe to dive in only kilometer mile in of the two venus in june of it first on the ninth of the month the descent the the touch the upper on the morning of june sixty-one kilometer mile the by the which produce kilometer mile thus the first probe ever to explore venus successfully one kilometer the open of the helium pump into the it to of meter foot on tether thirteen meter foot below the instrument properly know the top of the consist of cone which serve tether point to the it the electronics instrument connect the bottom nephelometer for cloud the with white finish to keep the corrode mist of sulfuric which the the drop into the night side of venus just north of the scientist be concern the would burst in the of so they it in the hemisphere to give the much time possible to return this the come down in the well effectively remove the system use on previous mission the wonder though if they could use floodlight to the one to in when soviet scientist think the enshroud in twilight due to the thick cloud cover the first for hour right into the hemisphere before it lithium cover kilometer mile the of burst in the do not the drop fifty kilometer thirty mile for this consider the most of the three cloud report by pioneer venus in indeed the push the speed up to kilometer mile

only two cloud of the three report by the probe the be three to five kilometer to mile thick of kilometer mile the cloud persist like thin fog until of kilometer mile much lower the pv one possibility for the cies be in the over the seven when the go silent the function of the mission the flyby bus on for million-kilometer million-mile journey the sun to become the first probe to meet comet on the bus the icy visitor before on in the soviet their first mission to two body with one vessel on june it for venus like it the to the twenty it on for hour before on the morning side of the during it

every hour give or three hour since both be still function their encounter soviet scientist consider option to send the probe to other object one prime the which could of six million kilometer million mile the soviet to out on the opportunity to become the first to fly when it discover there not enough fuel in the probe to be quietly shut down in future divert the impressive mission give some scientist numerous hope for even more expedition to the second world from the sun one the mission for the this soviet-french for the of multiple probe on single proton rocket in either or the would first swing by venus drop off probe the would be design to survive in the corrosive for up to one month improvement over the two the mission would then out to comet include possible on thus the mission the most reflective belt see from for venus to in the soviet union in the soviet decide to reroute the mission to the red of venus keep the comet by this time in the soviet interest focus on under construction entirely new probe design phobos two member of this be to in orbit the next phobos would then the first instrument on moon phobos this prelude to even more expedition include probe rover soil return explorer in the twenty-first century the environment of venus just too hostile for serious of in the future but thing to look for soviet venus both phobos probe to complete their mission one lose on the to the red in the other go silent in orbit just one week before the moon in of in devise for venus orbiter to drop eight to ten the in the mission move to the now be put on indefinite hold no other soviet mission to venus since be put forth twenty-five of continuous robotic of the during the economic over the soviet union president to open up his to the benefit of with the rest of the those in the west while the culture le oppressive in the the economy very rough ride it undergo the effect of free these effect hit everywhere include the mission level be cut the soviet to with other either to keep their or just to money in it report the soviet be offer for fully-equipped they in for the price of million incredibly low price for probe no take them up on the the unite up for new venus mission of their own the their with the of the shuttle on the shuttle the of from other probe design to the most complete of venus in history when the second world in of it would be to the entire down to resolution of meter foot the of in the interim probe from shuttle which would quick flyby of venus on it to orbit the jupiter in on october the shuttle it second probe into the who discover the probe moon in in the of powerful enough booster to send on direct flight to the the probe send venus time to build up enough speed to jupiter result venus first in of the probe of the swirl cloud further of lightning in violent on the with the incredible success of in the few new be out for further journey to venus scien tists in the to scientist in the former soviet union now the of independent since of effort to new mission within in the next the consider their own venus mission in the next few in of up with new venus project of their discovery for inexpensive probe throughout the system for venus two mission be select for further study venus multiprobe mission involve the of fourteen probe over one hemisphere to wind pressure the venus composition probe design to study venus while descend through the thick with the of much the soviet do since project decision will be in on venus will ever be to on the of venus present the crush pressure would be to life not protect in something even tougher be look into the environment of venus itself into something more like however it should be note such will require the of much of the thick dioxide reduction in the to speed up the to something bite once every such project century if not in the effort should be to better venus it exist we still yet to fully know how world so seemingly to in such will ever
