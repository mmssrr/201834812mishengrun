enough people believe in the of to for scientist to expect life on to do with the color on the this phenomenon lead to condition might support bloom of during the month life to become during colder period so six mission to be out four three fly by the one into orbit survey the extensively before the viking orbiter in fly on july come within kilometer mile of the to close-up picture of the the find occur but no evidence of or flow follow with their flybys during the summer of return picture show diversity of condition well thin cold dry of dioxide on the orbiter on mission to study of the the five month lift-off only to find in the midst of dust storm impossible for week but the storm return the first of picture these previously unknown include evidence of once flow the etch river flood in september the viking consist of orbiter lift off from kennedy center the mission design to question the red include be there life there nobody expect the to spot city but it hop the biology experiment on the viking would find evidence of primitive life or present viking the first to successfully touch down on when it on july while the unite it photo send from the chryse of gold show rusty-red return by the roll litter with rock by ripple dune fine red dust from the soil give the sky hue when viking touch down on on september it view more roll the one see by it predecessor one without visible dune the result send by the on viking be inconclusive of the red soil be test in three different experiment design to detect process while some of the test result seem to confirm this in to the soil chemistry be there life on no one know for sure but the viking mission find no evidence molecule exist there the viking record wind velocity direction well pressure few be observe the highest record by either degree celsius degree the viking site in midsummer the lowest degree celsius degree record the more northerly viking site during winter wind speed be the two during dust storm but the be so thin wind force be viking light of frost during it second winter on the the like of venus be dioxide nitrogen oxygen present only in only much our but even this condense out form cloud ride high in the or swirl the slope of tower of morning fog form in there be evidence in the denser to flow on the closely resemble shoreline gorge riverbed suggest river once the two moon phobos deimos they posse it be possible the moon be venture too close to be by it the viking orbiter exceed by their design lifetime of respectively the first to viking orbiter which stop on july when deplete it viking until when it shut down of viking orbiter quit on when the of it use up viking function on november despite the inconclusive result of the viking biology experiment we know more other except observer to be in september will our knowledge of the environment to of the red the system number of rocky object in orbit the sun but too to be consider full-fledged these object know or minor most but not find in or belt between the orbit of jupiter some orbit cross there be evidence be hit by in the one of the erode best preserve be the meteor winslow leave over from the of the system one theory suggest they the of destroy in collision long more likely never into in if the of into single object the object would be only kilometer mile le the of our moon of be identify from it be bright enough to be through telescope much of our come from piece of debris to the of on collision course with meteoroid when meteoroid strike our high velocity friction this chunk of to in of light know meteor if the meteoroid doe not burn up completely leave strike be meteorite one of the best to look for meteorite be the ice of of the meteorite percent compose of stone percent compose of iron nickel the rest mixture of the three stony meteorite the to identify since they look very much like rock since from the very system scientist interest in their composition fly through the belt find the belt be quite empty by very current future mission will fly by select for closer the orbiter by in october will on it to jupiter the comet flyby mission will study these object schedule for in the of the the mission project of the the of well the unite force the of energy one will mine the for jupiter beyond the belt in the outer region of our system lie the of jupiter neptune in the first of four to conduct the survey of these world of their moon of ice rock jupiter the first port of pioneer which lift off from kennedy center in the first to the belt to the outer region of the system in december it return the first close-up of jupiter fly within kilometer mile of the cloud top pioneer follow be in the summer of return of jupiter it of during flybys in these find jupiter to be whirl of liquid hydrogen helium top with colorful compose mostly of hydrogen helium ice form white cloud sulfur compound phosphorus produce the brown hue jupiter it be likely other to form molecule in the region between the frigid cloud top the hydrogen lie below of jupiter however these compound if they exist short-lived the red spot be observe for century through telescope on this storm in jupiter be more twice the of our high-pressure region the red spot spin in direction opposite to of low-pressure storm on jupiter it be surround by swirl current the spot sometimes consume by it the red spot might be million old our detect lightning in jupiter upper observe emission to northern light the region return the first of ring encircle jupiter of the system jupiter once every hour minute second the to complete journey the sun with know moon jupiter be something of system new mission to jupiter the project be under six cruise the orbiter once venus twice the moon once two the will drop probe into jupiter cloud to the orbiter will spend two circle the fly close to jupiter moon explore in the two pioneer two in his telescope jupiter spot four point of light orbit the for the first time see the moon of world in honor of their discoverer these four body would become know the or moon but might this honor for one look the return by the they fly these one of the most find of the mission the presence of on the moon io eruption never before be observe on world other the identify nine on io with plume of eject extend kilometer mile the moon io by yellow hue be the result of sulfur-rich bring to the by on this be the result of flex by the between io jupiter the other three moon the our moon be the brightest the moon complex of the crust be in like io be enough to it interior ice to melt produce this be cover by ice crust form where be expose to the cold of core be of rock to it center like the other two moon world of ice rock be the in the system the mercury pluto the be compose of percent or ice the rest rock of different brightness in the out of the moon interior deposit on the only slightly the lowest density of suggest of of it composition be the most object in the system no during it history old except more study of the will be perform by the orbiter no in the system be like it exquisite ring system be like jupiter be compose mostly of hydrogen but in to the vivid color wild turbulence find in cloud more subtle butterscotch hue it mute by give scientist be surprise the high-velocity jet blow some kilometer mile per hour three visit pioneer speed by the it moon in september return the first close-up follow in november send for the first time the complexity of ring system moon fly by the it moon in the ring compose of countless low-density orbit progressive from the cloud top of through the ring show the widely in from dust to boulder the ring bright they mostly ice frost rock the ring might result when moon or body venture too close to the unlucky object would be tear by force on it in it interior or the object not be fully form to begin with under the influence of third possibility be the object by collision with object orbit the either to form into moon or to drift from other ring to be hold in by the pull of it these complex form the of ringlet up the ring emission quite to the on during storm be detect by the these emission of lightning but believe to be come from ring system it where no lightning observe they jupiter the version of pole the discover new moon find the orbit we some moon shepherd ring ring the in the ring moon discover in from by in determine with one more like in composition the dioxide of venus of degree celsius degree imply there might be rise of liquid or sludge could not the moon dense cloud continue photochemistry from be convert to in with nitrogen hydrogen the compound be build block of these condition be to the condition of between three four billion however be believe to be too low to permit progress beyond this of chemistry the of will continue with the mission the will orbit the will deploy probe huygens which will be drop into to the will use the probe well to peer through cloud will spend the system in four visit complete the first close-up survey of the system the brief flyby more it retinue of icy moon be from grind since the discovery over two century by the english herschel third of the be of the system unlike the other with the exception of pluto this lie tip on it side with it north south pole the sun during swing the system during flyby the south pole the sun might be knock over when object collide with it in the life of the system find field doe not follow the north-south find on the other the field be tilt degree offset from the center phenomenon on would be like one pole in new york city the other in the city of on the of in consist of hydrogen with some percent helium of the blue color occur in it other color wind speed up to kilometer mile per hour the cloud top degree celsius degree sunlit south pole be shroud in kind of smog believe to be of other surround the extend of kilometer into be mysterious sheen know electroglow kilometer mile below cloud top there be think to be of dissolve some kilometer mile deep this be core of discover new moon kilometer mile in orbit the five previously know umbriel oberon in from to kilometer to mile represent these five moon sphere cold show evidence of include ice flow the most of moon be it high cliff well wind the in suggest the moon form it by collision with body event not in our system which object or from be be reform with some of the be in it interior expose on it think to nine ring in to ring which compose of bright ring up of chunk neptune complete it tour of the system with of neptune the moon on the sweep to within kilometer mile of neptune then fly on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it the more observe the spot storm the of in neptune resemble jupiter red spot the storm spin counterclockwise move kilometer mile per hour note spot cloud dub the scooter well cloud over the hydrogen helium cloud deck the highest wind speed of be observe up to kilometer mile per hour like the other neptune hydrogen helium upper over liquid interior the core higher of rock those of the other neptune distinctive blue like blue color be due to neptune field be tilt to the spin be not center the core this phenomenon be to field suggest the field of the two be in the core where the pressure be so liquid hydrogen the property of field on the other be produce by it spin core be only slightly tilt offset to it center shed light on the mystery of neptune ring from there be of in orbit the it not how neptune could how these could be keep from out into even unclumped ring detect these but they be in of thin complete ring number of moon could the but such body be not spot identify the moon triton in nereid in find six more one of the new moon proteus be nereid but since proteus orbit close to neptune it lose in the for observer on triton circle neptune in orbit in under six force on triton it to slowly the in to million short time in term the moon will be so close will it form ring to the modest current ring triton be unexpected those of io the moon more rock it triton be compose of but the moon crust be thin veneer of nitrogen the moon show two different type of the recede ice on the ice these the from geyser-like vent shoot nitrogen to height of to kilometer to mile triton thin only thick wind the deposit them on the ice the coldest yet find in the system degree celsius degree triton might be more like pluto other object so visit pluto pluto be the most of the yet the eccentricity of it orbit it inside neptune orbit where it be since where it will until pluto orbit be highly incline tilt degree to the of the other discover in pluto to be little more the be to be kilometer mile only two-thirds the of our moon pluto be cover with ice there be thin to the the move from the sun show pluto spin be tip by degree the one know discover in composition be different from pluto the moon to be cover with ice it orbit be lock with pluto so both body keep the hemisphere other pluto period period of revolution no ever visit pluto be currently explore the possibility of such mission comet the outermost member of the system visit to the inner the rocky of the of the system comet the icy debris from dim begin survive only from the sun most comet nucleus reside in the oort cloud loose of object in beyond the to the comet nucleus orbit in this until they perturb into new orbit them close to the sun nucleus inside the orbit of the outer the element of which it be by the time the nucleus enter the region of the inner these element boil the nucleus itself be only few mile be of with very to those compose the moon of the these boil off of the nucleus they form or cloud-like ten of of kilometer the grow the comet get closer to the sun the of come from the sun push on this cloud blow it like in the wind give rise to the comet ion blow directly from the nucleus but dust push more slowly the nucleus continue in it orbit the dust leave behind in curve both the dust point from the sun in effect the comet it it recede from the sun the million kilometer million mile in length but the of in this would fit in comet from the light show some comet through the system only once but others their orbit modify by close encounter with one of the outer these visitor enter close orbit return to the inner system comet be the most of short period comet return on of once every orbit from beyond neptune to within venus orbit confirm sight of the comet go to this visitor to our system be for sir edmond he plot the comet orbit predict it return on sight of motion his of lore when in the comet return on schedule sir edmond do not live to see it comet be very prominent in the sky if it close to on it most recent comet no closer million kilometer million mile from our world the comet visible to the eye for viewer in the southern hemisphere but it not comet be so bright on they be visible during comet sight be interpret omen be render in the sky the comet flyby will become the first to fly close to comet nucleus in proximity to it they both the sun will observe the nucleus it become in the grow sunlight begin to it lighter element boil off form fly by comet high speed the first explorer in of five two two soviet the giotto from the fly by comet in conclusion despite their effort to peer the of through obscure scientist of the only one body they could study closely but since through the system lift the veil on our neighbor in we more our system it member in the previous of our to the moon to the beyond our world except pluto they observe moon fly by comet the environment book now include picture of body be only smudge in the telescope for we lucky to be now to see these object the knowledge from our journey through the system redefine science like geology meteorology entirely new discipline by study the geology of moon comet difference we more the origin history of these body the system whole we insight into complex system by see how be on other world by the sun it influence throughout the system we better condition process on we will continue to benefit our explore our neighborhood in one current mission be venus others fly between world will the sun jupiter complex future mission for comet the belt we look to the time when will once set foot on world not be to the moon since december be for our return to the for the of even the of outpost one spend week or colony end
