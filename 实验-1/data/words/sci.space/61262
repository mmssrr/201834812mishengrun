subject re burster where they from in it enrico write from if of these thing be detect in look into possible problem with the detector be be there some cosmic could the dector to think it see one of these thing would not why widely detector such on ulysses pvo et would see burst the time in be fore this widely network the only sure to burst with only one detector one not burst except to it somewhere in the field of view with two detector one use the time the burst be see in detector to the to thin on the sky with three detector one get intersect give two possible if one of these be impossible the block of the sky you error box by detector of it own do it own but only to within degree would someone gsfc like like to comment on the current of inde pendent sight by other detector help drive down the you do touch on something you do to though some believe in reference i somewhere see in of grbs be by the detector it would be god though would like neutron but this be get too peter peterf of this be very very true but to to this detector build in just so the detector doe not the cosmic if i remember right the detector go off to the this be so they do energetic cosmic would set it off even with this buffer they still to throw out something like of the burst they do get of the belt the south the sun if i remember right there be either or in there couple other source well jeremy
