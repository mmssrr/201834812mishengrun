from subject frequently see edition list for edition dec post this list be offer reference for commonly in the newsgroups if i forget or botch your let me know if there not on this list confuse you drop me line if i figure it out i it to the list note this be intend to be reference for frequently see be most not encyclopedic if i every i ever i soon run out of disk the list will be post every comment it welcome i note this just tell the for you on your own for figure out they note the number of in use exceed i list they introduce omit further some for more one thing of edition of the list these on multiple line unless they simply different of refer to the thing to everybody who send suggestion since the first version of the list to who be independent list more verbose in mine to fischer dfi who be truly huge list count of term mostly in which i this time to ken hollis who send me copy of reference revise system truly tome of bonus the end of this post you will find perl write
