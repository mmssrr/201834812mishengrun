from rw wijers subject re burster where they i feel compel to the recent rule out merge neutron source of burst be utterly even though it be enough to it to press the behind the be follow if you two neutron together or neutron be gobble up by hole lot of energy be enough for burst but so the continue this energy be below lot of so the become you expect to see roughly spectrum the observe strongly so this model must be wrong so often the lie with the of the person who try to prove the model wrong with the model it be the energy be not see burst but the of energy be spew out flow when this into the surround medium strong flux of result which off of the energy this be not my it be in series of by rees peter sorry for the miss co-worker it be not complete model but it well be the best one sum over propose for the by the be the by woosley in which very the end of it life to hole if the core of the will be it be support by force form very dense neutron torus onto the hole this spew out jet the which constitute flow the of such event be much higher of neutron merger but the flux be more strongly so the net of burst observe on the between the two but the energy per event be lot le in the on note i do believe the must be resolve some method such find to the burst other or find definitive of some know of object in the distribution of position flux theorist not be too successfull in find the of object by prove there be only one possible in which the object work therefore it must be wijers
