from willner steve willner subject re of the sky in richmond stupendous write if the let me point out dust molecule provide of thing well from be different include cobe determine dust from to not close to the of order micron visible light with efficiency however below k of the emission will be beyond micron where efficiency be poor not long thus the must up more in order to the energy they moreover the of micron colder k will longer would be insensitive to them in the extreme limit cold k will be by worse still color by of these only when they hit by single photon they up to of hundred or k of course they cool quickly then cold for while but when they the be hundred k even of these the observe model for emission consistent with cobe three component these represent from dust color k emission from dust tc k emission from dust k the ecliptic pole the emissivities or dilution respectively the first two roughly double in the ecliptic to find the equilibrium we up the dilution time the fourth power of for component then the fourth root in the below come from number emission from the whole sky be to with b-v color of no doubt work could do much better the person who suggest dilution of must be remember wrong we would be cook if be the in event the energy density of come out the of the i believe to be correct dilution temp dust dust emission dust the fourth root of be k outside the system the result would be k i find these result surprise the of dust but i do see serious steve willner phone bitnet willner internet willner member for freedom lpf
