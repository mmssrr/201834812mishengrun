from tstroup subject re long term effect newsgroup in ken write the first item of business be to the life science in the whole of scheme of i to the joe schmoe doe seem interest or even curious i it think the joe be but see it elitist not one which he be ever go to in of u in our own contribute to comprehensive document which be to the public the world the document would the of long term in why be the public go to be interest in the of long term i like the of the study but it should be to other scientist engineer who will be to use it if you public document you need more i believe if long-term be to succeed we need to how to engineer our own microworld the only through the of engineer will good ecosystem be to life on flight one work on control life support system engineer the microworld be the problem the problem be the to be to engineer them efficiently for the only we know how to produce food be from food synthesis be not very so we to orbit well obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the grow of use dirt this be where the engineer come in but new technology bring new question we do the to like in dirt we grow lettuce right beside other but in hydroponics it turn out you do the lettuce growth be stunt when it grow in the hydroponic solution so now you to consider other go to this some scientific need to be do with technology be develop so we need to find out how they together where we now so i would like to see post of opinion the most objective method to the scientific for technology which be to first you need to do the there be lot of out there we should just pick specific of long term this could be useful if we it on the net then we look method of the technology such would be of interest to ourselves to exist in essence we would be divide the life science issue into problem which could be solve with technology this of solution to problem could form the of discussion involve people from the bionet isunet other source unless there be outpouring of interest on this on the net i think we should develop of the first then if we we go on to the itself could be useful for future engineer my response ken do you think tim
