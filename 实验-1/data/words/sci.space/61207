from subject news technology investor number this be number twenty-two in series on the include my think on these development sigh i get behind in get this column write i only the exigency of the current in the this column be put together lunch hour the house quiet down night so quickly build up if there lot of other stuff go on i comply lot of since the column so i go to to work to keep this one down to length fun content u in win two key remote sense venture get doc investment firm gd still good investment predict dip in ntsb over competitor be site drop from still proceed sign with swedish corp joint venture report south move into technology technology index through note u in the u of commerce project u will in with current show only percent growth over publish in u outlook which in revenue from the u business currently project to be m in to previous when u show double digit growth this project result drive by the u industry where project to drop from worth m in to worth m in the u outlook project in come while predict revenue will percent to m future will be by the revision in of defense offset revenue delivery revenue for fix mobile service project to to m drive by revenue from tv network remote sense product project to to m in up u revenue r e service fix mobile grind equip mobile equipment remote sense service revenue r revise for e for this be the first look how the u industry be expect to do in in not report with most of the news in the there of only few worth m or so influence the projection if we look over this sector should strong u firm be very successful in in the business furthermore of grind equipment should go up in the next revision of this expect to be mid on mobile grind equipment include such item gps receiver to be miss from the set doc publish list of business in the next revision of revenue should be then i expect the revise revenue should top m if the mobile grind equipment into the number the should show growth look beyond this future look quite promise the doc project service revenue could top m by if new mobile service direct implement mobile expect to continue to growth per through the mid my number more pessimistic for growth but i the trend should be for growth in u over the next my pessimism be due to more on growth in leo direct service i do believe of the current in the yet-to-be-born leo in the yet-to-be-proven direct will be success nor growth will be explosive currently project it should be note this doc be the first to show revenue from fund the m show in the be for the module for in on the shuttle but hide in these number the project first from the comet recovery experiment module win two key mcdonnell which build the vehicle win two inc in mid it select the to most of the in the iridium leo in mid mcdonnell the medium vehicle iii the service with for the iridium be for of iridium be to be by khrunichev enterprise in on proton vehicle these for the will be time provide for in the iridium such on-orbit be on of the service be report to be not yet the mlv go to mdc bid of their ii this be only worth million but set of option for up to from through these will deploy the next of the position system block iir plus other first option for to meet the option be expect to be exercise this which the be expect to request of up to per for under this the request on service from mdc for the time period with to occur within of the request if these two fulfil they should provide excellent business for mdc through the turn of the century combine these two for worth m to mdc core business of other for well for medium will to this business keep mdc however it should be note there risk element in these iridium leo not yet receive u commission license for in the nor line up the for the iridium venture without these or there will be no iridium but hopefully these will be settle this the mlv iii be the of which slow the production of the gps block iir delete the fund for the mlv iii in of the nls this time while it the mlv iii will be execute future fund for the mlv iii other be be reconsider of review some opinion express from within the congress propose of elv include the mlv in of the propose such opinion some weight in this budget dod fund will be more difficult to find in the shrink u defense budget remote sense venture get doc the first license to remote sense in by the u of commerce office of commerce license to worldview of to build of leo to provide of the there be little on this venture by worldview the doc other the of the construction license this report to be the request of worldview most industry identify this new venture spinoff use sdi-type technology to provide sense into gi for remote user most customer for this service include geologist it be noteworthy this be the first venture under the remote sense policy the november provide remote sense from remote sense be sell to user differ price prior to this remote sense from to be sell to user the price remote sense venture would to sell the government-set price there rumor of other remote sense venture work their through the system different of development i think the spot system will provide the of the remote sense for the next or so in to these government-sponsored remote sense system venture such worldview others exploit niche use technology i believe find on the i predict there be some very interest venture in the next or so investment firm gd still good investment street investment house think system division could still be despite in the in recent report we more ever convince if the return the to it plus success this will become highly unit upon discussion with gd project if the problem up the unit could see m in per by m per by this be upon gd projection of per on the world three in row of their system hurt system division since gd restructure to only keep very few core business pundit be gd business might be next to be sell the report gd system division some despite current problem if they get their together project to be m in which will loss of m if gd their project of the if they to up the of their then they could profit from those but until they the be on this division will continue to show loss in response to the sell-off rumor in my opinion this be not good for quick to do such the current set would be with set from outside the firm in gd ssd to get the division on the will to on the problem with the well in sell service this would only firm with experience in rocket could find such in-house be to convince customer to buy their service the firm would liquid rocket experience experience in technology well for this might be trw rockwell lockheed possibly mcdonnell boeing but most of those firm flow problem mdc business boeing mdc involve with other firm lockheed or on debt come up with the m price for the division be big chunk of for predict dip in the of the system be project dip in in the in their survey which their projection of the for the next over short run expect to their position of the of through hold for vehicle hold mcdonnell hold long vehicle hold of future for which compete project to come from with the split between scientific most of the future growth be predict to come from the region expect the current of into or group will continue with these group invest in with more predict the of should by over level to kg in geo for service be expect to strong over the next three but in the second of the predict will this prediction upon of supply new compression technique to could double or triple use exist or one of the possible in the identify the of new vehicle include system but predict in the long term investor service look for the best off between service price other new service will to prove out their service their will be their survey i report on their prior survey in issue of the two survey there difference in the number the most be the of new compression technique reduce the for new on orbit i note in to some prediction for to be strong while fiber optic line into the point-to-point grow for service world wide for point-to multipoint service prevent in fiberoptic provide higher service but only from point to point b to fiberoptic link it be to between the point while there improve network solution network of distribute fiberoptic link cost million or billion of for service where there be not exist grind network structure still offer the most cost effective solution if new service require into new region it be to link cost only few ten of of tie into the exist network this growth of new service keep high the for fiberoptics be grow well since grow between the point service it become cost effective to fiberoptic link to the in since the still grow projection rosy but get longer lifetime current now get of of on-orbit service or more in to of service from this cut some of the owner reschedule over longer note do it this but it look like the will be over supply by exist system in the term the be for medium per from the supply side be of up to medium be of per be of long h-vehicle proton of other system such medium per lot of for we only expect the competition to intensify for ntsb over the feb by science over of rule order from officer to the mission override the in of rule in the few minute of the countdown one of two receiver the such scrub officer issue mission order minute before the schedule somehow this override by the osc or the lose in the the despite the the function expect the receiver not need but this incident do since order give under rule not obey the be the ntsb with support from osc the force this the first time ntsb the on incident involve to the ntsb their will month be look line of link procedure use in the this be the first time the ntsb lead into their request by the of commerce office of who license the the time of write this column some of the be conclude some of the result to out into the press or four different be in use during the test the destruct receiver stop respond the test director controller in the mission control room order minute before the to the mission rule this should stop the somehow the osc test conductor order the reverse the on the net order to the the second before differ of how this propose with the best set be line of definition of the responsibility of the mission control of the mission rule be not before the we see more more more of these issue go to crop up will to be resolve this be interest it be the first time the ntsb be in to problem they do with problem i think this problem will turn out to be problem with procedure will be up with of guideline on how should be set up how specific line of should be competitor be enterprise in it be new system upon convert icbm component two version of the be the wing vehicle like the osc the severkosmos from mobile grind the be project to deliver kg to km orbit or kg to km orbit the severkosmos to be of kg to km orbit kg to km propose to be use with these system be leo system enterprise be describe focus on protection of which in the development of the shuttle system they the npo in outside of moscow there very little on this new venture my suspicion be it be enterprise look for currency try to upon their in-house knowledge of ex-soviet system it to the list of numerous from the ex-soviet union this one little different in they offer of ex-soviet icbm but i identify key customer be or site drop from in tech institute the result of study on the of rocket site in county the old missile test site on the the study recommend the site not be pursue site reopen the site not due to project low investment return plus other however the report do the site might be for other us recommend other us this should put the in the coffin of the site while other site still proceed with site development find without key customer to if to be put in then the expect return be too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key in judge the of site these include be there identify key customer to provide core sufficient to recover setup cost be there of use the site exist be use or modify the site be find low enough cost to support the investment other site venture include those poker york white off-shore to be judge these in my opinion some of these venture fly on hope not on sound grind still proceed in one of his former president bush technology for joint venture between u other firm one of these propose use of u technology by to build booster with impediment remove the vehicle will development this for first in the time period the be describe solid booster design to put kg into leo site be for the system include on the on the by in the project report it m in development fund will use technology from condor vehicle well from the u firm identify opportunity in provide for the from firm or currently use either or the scout however opportunity limit the scout be be out by some in the government industry follow-on system this leave niche for new system surprisingly enough not support development of such system within the current fund structure study be perform by british deutsche but with the exception of the system report below i not be to find other development work with even rumor of fund for of interest be the link of the to the condor there be some interest rumor out of over the fund under the which rule the country in the be know be in feb the force control of the condor missile to the new comison de the condor describe in upon the condor rocket in with egypt with support of firm the condor reportedly fund indirectly by in the solid rocket motor be build test but development of of the propulsion system it should be note be to it first scientific in the u m kg will study the upper include experiment from the u no vehicle yet be select but osc the rocket report to be strong contender for this sign with swedish corp firm in herndon in it receive m from the swedish corp to on vehicle this will be perform of the service ps joint center swedish corp to the rocket in offer into the region to ps be perform m of the include new fully enclose build for vehicle like the be choose the rocket supplier for the service to be offer by ps from the of the of the swedish not specify be try to line up customer fund for their vehicle for some time now the be two rocket fuel by liquid oxygen from the engine design for the rocket build of off the shelf component upon the module descent engine build by trw of put kg into km orbit be try to construction for it first three vehicle with first for for my record show hire trw to provide support system design with engineer to be do by builder closely with in the build the swedish would supply engineer vehicle subsystem support sumitomo corp of tokyo be first round investor sit on the of director get first round of k some source this of high m but be for for the m need to design build their first set of vehicle the from ssc possibly be use to help bring some investor on but by my they will need much more the single m to put their venture into joint venture report in it report joint venture between chinese in the work report in the press development corp cdc in with link to the rule be to set up joint venture in hong kong with industry corp with the objective of cdc would cover of the system cost u m in for right to of the this close on the heel of the of for development in mid in those the office of will with kg scientific for in two both trw be help this budget t b u m through i be to between this venture those of the nspot but there might be connection while the to pursue venture the current might not support two venture the report for the system be but i do think this with the exist hong involve chinese hong kong other investor other use it model there some obvious to pursue such joing venture it could provide excellent experience to for very low cost which then be use in venture but there issue between chinese venture but put joint venture through hong kong might it to proceed in the be light up with growth project in service revenue this be just to to the list south move into technology south industry resource ministry recently to invest u b in development u b into for technology technology be of this begin with of multi-purpose by the objective of this investment be to south technology to the level of the world top country by south be quietly work to develop it industry include i note this new come into the of their effort for telecom will be in oct on the will provide television telephone service throughout the southwestern portion of border north south it first on in our cost u m be for in october of this on will be entirely in project for will be environment monitor this be the precursor to series of the keos system project which be submit for to the south government would use two or three equip with sensor south press report there be effort to the for build by supposedly government be to oversee such effort fund u m between in of expect pullout of system from the in conjunction with of these report effort south be pursue production work either off-sets to exist technology for mcdonnell be offset production of some to south firm of the or for production of consumer item other product south export receiver television setup to for production of osc orbcomm user this look like very push into technology consider be currently the grow sector for service for south push into technology the composition of there over the next technology index through in the issue will give the result of stock index portfolio stock investment the below result to the end of the technology index do quite bite better the whole represent by the s p index since of the include in the index u firm this represent in the of firm the in the first be more in of which be very promise sign future month reverse this trend the technology index do quite well but the pure portfolio consist of stock of firm which pure in technology it result in of we keep eye on these index result through begin begin to s p tech index tech index tech pure note this column full i still bunch of development to report on i the of this column there be lot of interest but i to put them into the next issue look i get in the work on new with iridium the leo more news on on the new venture other interest development i hope you folk find this stuff useful interest comment welcome technology investor multos box
