from steinly steinn sigurdsson subject re burster where they in prb write evidence burster very their distribution be very isotropic the intensity distribution crudely we see edge to the distribution give the enormous power i just wonder if they hole or something like close by why would they to be now in the good old before gro it think the burster be neutron in the it expect gro would confirm this by either show they be within few hundred light or they be in the not know but one exist to be it note the brightest burster in the lmc suggest theorist might be wrong then the sun be not the center of the should show disk be rule out completely this to the you to push the out the energy then get the of get n out become we should to see for the burster the be consistent with either oort cloud distribution but only just but no one think of source with the right spectrum or it be hence isotropy the edge be the edge of the universe if you need very high energy to detect very source for spectrum ergo neutron collide with neutron or hole even then get the spectrum be very but if we know physic level the burster not due to hole or cosmic string wrong spectrum for one thing the be further by recent there two of source in the collide n they fit into the ns-ns ns-bh collision respectively my own pet theory be it fly enter but the i be most everyone they collide nuetron or spin hole i just wonder if could exist them closer in if you think of one remember to invite me to stockholm steinn sigurdsson lick steinly the of very very strict you just bend them for your own benefit
