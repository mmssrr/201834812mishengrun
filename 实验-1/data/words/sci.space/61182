from m subject re burster where they prb write evidence burster very give the enormous power i just wonder if they hole or something like close by why would they to be burst grbs see come from direction however give the number of bright one there too few one to be consistent with be dense for we see it be if they within finite sphere or sphere with edge with u the center these you hide sufficiently number of different type of grb with different origin in the i there be only one of grbs the we le of the of the center of the distribution the only thing the be the center of the system the of the oort cloud of comet beyond pluto the universe theory grbs throughout the universe require energy to be over of millisecond oort cloud model tend to be silly even by the of if grbs be distribute through the milky you would expect them to be either in the of the for or the center for we do see this so if they they must be in light in we would to see grbs from the it for the be from the center of the my own pet theory be it fly enter the in the know we do see come from reticuli ceti but the i be most everyone they collide nuetron or spin hole i just wonder if could exist them closer in there more grb different model in the referee right now the theorist sort of on new model until new evidence come in m
