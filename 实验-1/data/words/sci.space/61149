from kjenks subject redesign jsc i mb worth uuencode gif outline one of the design be consider in city mr work down the from me be for comment or mholderm propose this design which he geode rough on the outside but gem on the inside or the et with module centrifuge you see from file it us shuttle et in of much of the truss which be currently of freedom the white on the outside of the et be use by the remonte system srms by the control system rcs pod this the rcs pod to move the so thrust occur the center of cg of the the property of the during the inline module design the shuttle to dock more it closer to the cg strong of the in the current ssf design dock force limit to pound which seriously the design of the dock system the et would pre-flight with little we the to put et into orbit to some rumor which here but we never to do it while we some good not to control debris de-orbit footprint once on-orbit we would vent the the et sofi either erode on-orbit from with oxygen or b where it be we deploy it to protect it keep it from the environment option b the of provide further micrometeor protection the et be incredibly strong remember it support the whole during could serve the nucleus for much more design budget permit the white module the end of et set of control moment gyro to be use for control while the rcs will be use for gyro the module de-orbit system which be use the end of the life to perform control de-orbit so we do kill more like we do with the centrifuge which the volume module could be use for long-term study of the effect of or on the centrifuge will be use momentum device for the whole control system the centrifuge be mount on one of the module opposite the et the this design us most of the exist ssf design for system get from the ssf work do to propose this design joe committee in city he report he receive however the rumor i design on wingless shuttle orbiter seem more likely note this text be my of design you should see his note in the gif file of post mb file to i try to post these for in but it out of i let you know when i get do ken jenks shuttle office kjenks development of the be the rise of the sun wernher von
