from prb subject re hst service mission schedule for in write in prb write in strider greg moore write herny point out you to develop the thruster while much lighter you still to lift the of the thruster to orbit then the thruster lift it own weight into higher orbit you up room in the yes but the improvement in boost orbit to the hst be i do not you here be improve be doe this to do with more equipment on service mission imply by other poster why do you need to boost the orbit on this mission you something here but could you it for u on the net right now the hst sevicing mission be list before it list they just kick up the number of to it not in the they go to re-boost the hst orbit i think right now it sit mile up they would like i do know the orbit number i know when hst first fly it in the highest possible shuttle orbit now the shuttle thing the edo or extend orbiter it mostly for the fuel cell rcs plus more for the life support more nitrogen too the limit on be function of suit supply orbiter in order to perform the re-boost of the hst the oms engine will be fire for long period now the shuttle be thing the hst be light either the of oms fuel need to fly both up be booster up use to boost hst on it own will weigh le then the oms fuel require to boost both hst shuttle for give from i the on the hst mission tight enough they even suit or mmu now if they use tug i would bet just wild guess the on would the edo suit more for the fgs sensor for the electronics still enough for double of or the hst could even get into some sort of medium orbit the they high orbit be le point longer life you then edo enough so the shuttle mission go on long enough to fix the tilt motor god know else be go to out from i the motor fine it be one of the two set of electronics control the motor need fix the motor electronics piece of i expect to be correct if i wrong on this it be the problem in the tilt be big on hst ops
