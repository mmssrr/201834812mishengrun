from leech jon leech subject probe history probe mission this section lightly from post by mostly minor wiener contribute the section on the section on from post by yoshiro u mission venus mercury flybys orbiter the first to send to venus minute in the instruction from the grind stop the rocket due to problem with it so the computer take control however there turn out to be bug in the the rocket promptly go off course so the officer destroy it the bug be sometimes to be incorrect do it error in which the smooth omit from the expression sub n nth smooth of of this error lead the to minor of velocity if they be serious to incorrect the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of it return which confirm venus be very hot degree now revise to degree f world with cloud-covered compose of dioxide sulfuric confirm in on november lose when it protective shroud to eject the into to collect the sun energy for power from it the probe soon die when it out be now in orbit it intend for flyby with the sister probe to do in take the first close-up of the in it fly by the the probe find world with much thinner previously think scientist conclude from this world in both the sense send to venus in it reconfirm the on collect five by plus the venus pressure it be time of or the of be foot under the of be send to in upon the work do by four however they to the concept of first from the of end up in the in when the rocket the sister probe to the first to orbit in it return on the red no other probe do before huge on the well system evidence once flow the the probe take the first closeup of two moon phobos deimos use venus to mercury in the probe do return the first close-up of the in previously unseen in the cloud cover plus the the entire cloud system circle the in four three flybys of mercury from to before run out of control the probe mercury world with much think this would seem to mercury iron core which up percent of the entire pioneer moon sun venus jupiter flybys orbiter pioneer through to meet their objective to the moon close-up but they do enough into to provide new on the between the moon include new on the belt circle three with their rocket pioneer on october pioneer on november pioneer on december pioneer moon probe which miss the moon the first to orbit the sun in pioneer design to flyby venus but the mission down it study the environment between venus out to million kilometer in record until pioneer through be into orbit from to pioneer still this time pioneer e would be number suffer in pioneer the first to flyby jupiter in pioneer follow it in then go on to become the first probe to study in both vehicle should continue to function through off into the first ever to do so pioneer venus know pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer burn up in the on october pvo the first study of the probe pioneer venus know pioneer send four probe into the in december of the bus burn up high in the while the four probe descend by the though none be expect to survive to the the probe do it for minute on the grind before it mission be test probe for the series they be for high orbit test in but rocket problem leave them in useless low orbit which quickly on intend to instrument on the of the moon but problem during the the probe to miss the moon into orbit do try to some of the moon it fly by but the deep during the the purpose but suffer problem enroute on the the first probe to the moon without return october to lose power enroute miss the moon drift off into orbit through more modify mission they be to send live of the they with the moon this objective in when it do not through perform well become the first probe to return of through orbiter orbiter through be design to orbit the moon site be study for the mission of the probe contribute to our of the five probe of the series from to be successful in their mission they be the first probe to orbit the moon los be into the to interference with the mission surveyor soft the surveyor series be design to see if module could on the of the moon without sink into the soil before this time it by some the moon cover in of dust which would not support vehicle surveyor successful in prove the strong enough to hold up from to only surveyor be unsuccessful mission the rest the first probe to soft on the moon of scoop the soil for foot from surveyor in return of the to surveyor the of the series purely scientific mission which explore the tycho region in viking orbiter viking from on on rocket the probe go into orbit on june the set down on the western slope of chryse on july it soon it for there be still to whether the probe find life there or not send incredible color of it surround one thing scientist sky pinkish in color not blue they think the sky be pink due to sunlight reflect off the reddish dust in the thin the set down field of red boulder stretch out it could the viking orbiter keep function until when it out of the switch into mode where it be hop it would keep function through but november be send to the tell it to shut down until further order never despite the engineer effort through of interest side note viking be the mutch in honor of the of the the museum in be entrust with the of the mutch until it be to the by expedition viking on september in orbit on the touch down on september in it the it sister with the exception it seisometer work record one the orbiter series of in which prompt it be shut down july the shut down on the orbit of both viking orbiter should outer flybys september fly jupiter on by on november before fly by jupiter on by on by on by neptune on take of to slingshot it from outer to outer could in principle pluto but jpl opt for the sure thing of close up between the two probe our knowledge of the their their ring become immense discover jupiter lightning three new be discover two of the surprise be jupiter ring io sulfurous with effect on the when the two probe they discover over ringlet include the predict shepherd keep the ring the with jupiter jet with white cycle be know smoggy one it the the big surprise here the of the ring kink speak be both unexpected difficult to to heroic engineer effort continue the mission to neptune itself highly in one oddity it find to be highly skew from the completely skew give icy be find on of different one more ring be discover in to neptune find to include numerous cloud the ring turn out to be bright on one ring two other ring other be discover neptune skew triton geyser liquid the two expect to for two more their journey give evidence possible beyond pluto their next scientific discovery should be the of the soviet mission since there be so soviet probe to the moon venus i will highlight only the mission soviet probe in miss moon first in orbit first to on in take first of in take first of in since test for future mission first probe to soft on the moon in return from first probe to orbit the moon in second successful soviet soft mission in first successful through mission through the probe be test of orbit vehicle first probe to on moon return of soil to in mission in deliver the first rover to the moon lunokhod in with in soviet mission to return soil in soviet venus probe first venus mission lose enroute in to venus during flyby mission in with probe just before encounter in of no be return to on just before encounter entire probe the first to on in first probe to successfully return while descend through crush by pressure before in mission profile in first probe to return from the of in more mission in send first of in the first probe to orbit venus mission return first color of in mission with of section of in more pvo with first probe of in include two flyby bus go on to become first to study comet close-up in of soviet probe first probe in enroute the follow first possible to on probe enroute in first soviet probe to on orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red in first successful soft on but second in orbit in rocket to fire probe go on into orbit first fully successful soviet mission orbit in return of to probe in into the miss completely in go into orbit with it flyby bus phobos first to probe on of moon phobos probe enroute in due to error phobos to probe on moon phobos the probe do enter orbit in but one week before schedule phobos while there be of soviet jupiter even probe within the next thirty no step yet be with these project more intensive study of the moon venus comet be for the mercury mission to orbit probe on the tiny world be for how the in the former soviet union now the of independent will the future of their to be see mission from the center by on comet within million km on the be three instru ments to wind of which work now so swingby by on into orbit to the the closest on the geocentric km this be the first for during the observe the some will be schedule in some hence the second will be on june re the third october re hiten probe into orbit on the then know but to hiten once in orbit the lb probe loop out from it first flyby on where it drop off it lb midget this point the third to orbit the moon join the unite ussr the in orbit the moon break the scientist to lose of it rocket motor fire on schedule on but the the rocket fire of confirm use the schmidt the kiso in hiten multiple flybys monthly perform experiment use the hiten close to the moon jst on the height of km from the moon fire it propulsion system for ten minute to put the into orbit the follow be the result the km km deg to ecliptic period mission reference i recommend the follow work in three group overview specific book on mission source on probe this list be by no complete it be design to give you to your through work on the subject if pertinent work to the list it would be though i recommend the book list below i think it would be best if you out with the overview book in order to give you of the history of in this i recommend you pick up some good work on the sol system to give you some most of these book be find in good public university some of the more recently publish work be in order through good bookstore

flyby the odyssey of irl first to venus the story of poynter l the story of mission murmur of with the record on in the probe find by intelligence in well the probe mission objective themselves other work publish very book on every probe mission it good university will these book they find simply by know which mission you wish to i recommend these work you first study some of the book list some i recommend for on probe which write on the pioneer probe to moon the jupiter the surveyor orbiter mission to the mission to mercury venus the viking probe to the mission to jupiter neptune more on soviet probe mission be find in sky telescope science scientific time newsweek supply not only on mission but show you else go on with the time event be unfold if be of interest to you mission by numerous economic you know depend on just how your interest in probe will go you might wish to join the society one of the group in the world to their the report the probe mission write to the society north good luck with your study in this of i find mission to be one of the more excite in this field the benefit society will receive from it incredible with yet to be next upcoming probe mission
