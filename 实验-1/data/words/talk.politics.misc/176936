it be on top of no or to south in respect it in to the in the the be occupy for while by colonist in the british expel them take over the for other the belong to not but no such be possible for south it be control by never by or the of south look even more from point of view men they think in term they be well of time south could not possibly be hold for long by it they be set themselves up to the by so the question be why do bother with the seemingly worthless south my friend the to these question not or economic south posse enormous secret it underground bury under the the northwest end of the the for the crisis be this secret together with two other which i will describe shortly the secret complex be in existence for they not new be new be the of the bolshevik here in for the two month i be report the of this new to you quickly i verify them the for one to erupt by september of this it be this the crisis to erupt now be go on now be effort to spoil of the bolshevik for the come the enemy of the bolshevik here the rockefeller new ruler in the kremlin behind the present crisis they try to ruin of the project which i month be to be world by the bolshevik both the unite be destroy in one i mention month the key to this be the existence of secret stockpile in the world the bolshevik here in work with other bolshevik in key position of other country to set off do they intend to ride out the they in government bunker when the lie smolder the bolshevik will the of their host country they will the secret bring their into the open they will confront the world with the only fresh powerful force on use power they will become the undisputed ruler of the world be they to do this they to the for world very soon by set off one in of month the rockefeller new ruler work together in time to try to off the bolshevik month i mention the bolshevik here benefit from which be by the rockefeller long it only be three since the rockefeller be dislodge the prime mover of the unite government by the bolshevik since time the unite government be house divide tear by power struggle between bolshevik rockefeller but before the unite be for both by the four rockefeller brother in the brother new for world it two-prong visible secret which i first describe long in letter no it for the unite to to the teeth in secret while to without the the yet simple by the rockefeller-controlled unite would itself into with then the secret include would be to over the world when they set the in motion in the rockefeller brother be look to by the their conclude very the be would very different effect on the northern southern hemisphere both superpower the unite the soviet union well up in the northern hemisphere so the other full-fledged power red by the for in the southern hemisphere few between in other word it expect the come would be northern hemisphere in it be know serious will to even not hit by but there limit to how the cloud it discover long there be very little mix between the of the northern southern hemisphere in the northern of our cold from the north pole work it the then it work it to the north mirror of this process up the southern of the northern southern hemisphere meet in the but very little of the the conclusion my friend be this the come could ruin of the northern hemisphere for to come but if the right the southern hemisphere could by the this music to the of the four rockefeller brother quick look the globe of the world show why the rockefeller ever since world ii i discuss in my very first monthly letter nelson rockefeller solidify the grip on during the he this of hemispheric defense for then-president d roosevelt so of the south continent it resource then there be the continent there too rockefeller control in effect over wide of south of the this to the effort of john d rockefeller iii i in letter no look the globe the most from the of world new to world ii both be wide open to the rockefeller the rockefeller brother decide to secret in the southern hemisphere for use the come by this they expect to become the of the survive southern of the northern hemisphere then the northern hemisphere recover from the the rockefeller empire would be to pick up the piece in this the third rockefeller brother expect their to inherit the in order to control the southern hemisphere the some would to be to project power onto for revolt rockefeller would require troop not from the on the moon the most for of the world find to be minimum of two secret fleet would be require one in the south the other in the south since the reserve fleet be to be keep secret until the northern hemisphere they could not be build in exist new construction to be build they to be hide to hide entire be no they up lot of on top of it the ship hide they be build the best to to combine the into one secret the secret to be to otherwise if it existence be ever discover the secret might be wipe out the combine requirement for secrecy protection be but one in while these be still in the of development the present itself during trip to sweden rockefeller give tour of unique hide port the port be hollow out from solid cliff which come right down to the the to the port be hole in the side of the cliff which be off with enormous steel door inside this big on the huge be hollow out to ship the rockefeller brother their decide bigger more secret better protect version of the swedish hide port just they survey of site then the site survey cover throughout the southern hemisphere be reject very quickly the wrong other be reject they be too close to the still others to be rule out there be too people live the desire level of secrecy impossible it the site choose for the secret be secure the site for the secret be select in the south extreme southern new select this be i to in letter no three month when i to new extreme in the come in order to the the secret new to be divide up into two site close together one be the extreme southwest tip of south where the know the southern come down to the edge the other of the be build into the northwest tip of which be off the tip of south the be hollow out within rise know mt the new meet the requirement ever since world ii the government of new be tie even closer to the unite to the be from the the bury deep under protect from they too deep to be by the new site be well to the entire south in the south even more perfect site find site my friend be south it be perfectly for of the entire south the rugged provide perfect for the secret the northwest tip of the long it be control by whose government like of new will to south except for on the the some mile from the secret new which be build but take no in the close down since time there be no on south except for few scientist construction of the secret two in new one on south in the the technique be from those use previously to build other underground such the inside cheyenne however these technique be in new to construction directly from the of in this the shelter leave undisturbed in both during construction the cut in the side which be to let ship in out be keep possible be well like the swedish hide port the to the secret be up when the be impossible to detect unless you know where it be unlike most construction project there no or pile of leftover rock lie to the which house the secret enormous but the rock debris dispose of once the secret be build they to be outfit for ship construction docksite the of the unite during the contribute to this from to one role in this rockefeller scheme he of defense robert through the preside over the public of visible power this include the close down of entire we be not tell where equipment go where it go my friend to the new secret which be be outfit in new south the secret be use to reproduce ship design build here in the unite defense weinberger tell congress recently it be to build two ship time be true if the second ship be of the first this become even more true in recent through the use of technique the secret fleet which be build the secret up of of other ship they power sub cruiser destroyer yes three of them secret twin build for the for the eisenhower for the vincent be through the cost overrun so we in the defense three be provide with full complement of whose the the ship of the secret bolshevik fleet of other vessel even so the secret ship posse one key difference month i the succeed in develop kind of invisibility shield this technique object invisible from by distort light in it vicinity whole new fleet of now go into production use this principle my friend of the secret bolshevik ship be outfit with equipment the principle be to to ship to there be more room for the powerful equipment the field one the secret of the bolshevik would be light of other leave on it would be perfect for the intend role of world the rockefeller set it in motion long my friend but three they lose control of the unite now it the bolshevik who in control they bend on these secret be be the crisis topic in letter r no month i describe project the new bolshevik for one elite group of bolshevik here flush out the right now secret here in it by which the unite will strike the first blow follow by with set off the the bolshevik here in other country to rise it out in bunker one out in they to behind the of the unite her of their they to unveil their secret their secret fleet with these they to conquer rule be leave of the world the unite we know it will be go but in the eye of the bolshevik themselves this outcome will constitute victory up to now the which i first two month be still on they still shoot for to begin by september of this time be run out the bolshevik here sprint they but my friend the bolshevik not the only runner in this they two enemy both of whom determine to trip up the bolshevik one enemy of the bolshevik here be the rockefeller the other enemy be the new rule clique in now these two enemy of the bolshevik pool their effort in in letter no three month i report limit new in the work between the rockefeller the the meet between gromyko in turn point in the of this it be now be responsible for the crisis now the it should be this new between the rockefeller short of true they very dispute to be settle between them but for the time be they truce between themselves to with their enemy the bolshevik here in the first priority of the the rockefeller be to slow down the bolshevik for imminent if they do time be on the side of the rockefeller in movement which i discuss summer in letter no slow-down in the will give more for to be implement the joint decide by the bolshevik very quickly no other type of hope of effect enough to prevent by the end of this summer the of the project not know to either the rockefeller or the but the outline know to be i describe month it decide should be devise would undermine of the bolshevik be the bolshevik-controlled secret fleet in the southern hemisphere should be cripple by work together the rockefeller the be to devise which neither could out the rockefeller group who build control these provide intelligence the best to them the with their enormous provide the muscle to out the it to devise scheme would both secret fleet in the south south to be of either fleet would the bolshevik still conclude very quickly direct on the new out of the question there no of frogman or other force which could possibly keep secret from the outside world on the new would set off the very which the rockefeller to prevent but the in the south different in the of south it heel the extreme which protect the secrecy of the south covert the key with her to the i mention in topic the rockefeller of for be send to to work out with the government there the historic dispute over the to be use to provide ruse cover to the south to be the be not tell everything the by but they be tell enough to they be to do inducement to the be promise they be the shoot over the would in this include the promise of covert need the to bolster the trouble economy it promise the rockefeller will help develop the immense offshore oil reserve with these combine promise of glory the to the on out in the joint group of of thing the old on south supposedly they be there to the old build them off to sell while they be it they the over the work-site the british nervous south promptly expect the british survey ship put they drive off the tear down the the incident provide the desire excuse for the to bring the simmer dispute to boil from time to time in the south be of the it be by be very flimsy but it now in very it nothing new to this from so there no hint of during force for on the nothing new think the british high out in the time it believe they be to do it but on force do the unexpected this time they the public the to the themselves but just for good the next force south the force so it the it just side show from point of view however the contingent of be overpower bundle off the with group of scientist the moment of in the joint to the by the force get onto the undetected on the rockefeller the the move to on the directly the secret high-speed drill equipment set up by the rockefeller member of the while the member on defense by even the high in london the secret south under by the only possible the joint be drill down through the the hollow out inside it only of time until their drill would through the ceiling of the hide once the hole the next step obvious the would put of some kind through the hole the best guess it would be nerve the shock go through the highest level of the british government on the even of be describe my friend the government like the here in be bolshevik control why me too time the or doe both government to the secret in complete of the people of their respective country on the even of they suddenly discover their precious in deep deep trouble the government to for the south the order of the the drill on south proceed the clock the best be the drill would through into the roof of the in three week on or if help do not south by then the secret might be doom the force the itself be to defend themselves under the their mighty ship be ship in bottle they do not open the bottle to out to fight the be with to open the door would be suicide on just two south some ship move out of british port the lord foreign minister he force to resign my friend he the rockefeller by the new the home of the other secret fleet break with the two hide new be on red the twin be order to ship be undergo but still leave seven ship inside the hide twin include one of the i mention on busy of foreign minister the unite in new york he by the deployment of such of the hurry here to to seek from he get them for the next two week or so the news fill with story the slow movement of the british fleet while go on my friend only cover story the join up move possible south if the force in time to the secret likely the story slow movement of the british be intend to give cushion of time for if need be the fleet would to south then it could move on to the on the schedule in this the of south would be hide the big secret preserve it expect element of the british fleet would the vicinity of south within two week would be soon enough to the joint stop the drill before it complete but cosmospheres of the key element of the south contingent leave two before it shortly they do so they into trouble cosmospheres close in on single ship which to the on south the cosmospheres the bridge center of the ship with neutron in moment the ship without it silence then sub close in quickly finish off this key british ship with torpedo it break with explosion so be know there be no survivor this unexpected shock in the produce two result both first it slowdown in the the south by the british the force to be regroup into better suit for enroute defense but cost time public from london the progress of the fleet reflect this slowdown the for on the stretch out longer longer this buy time for the joint on south the drill continue the other result of the sink word to the south to for possible it obvious the get involve in the which the could be in big trouble during the of night the seven ship put to from their twin secret in southern new they deploy to secret in the mile of new their shield be to provide protection from these shield it impossible to with the outside world or even to see it i month but once they the the ship hook up to buoy equip with shield to the the in turn in touch with the south by of the tip of south the deployment of the ship of the south fleet the joint hop for the ship be flush out from their hide in new the british ship sink of follow by other event on the move out of port the in buenos supposedly he there but in he there with be the top of the rockefeller i in the he sure the do not get cold foot down moment four leave for he his somberly tell reporter time be run out so it my friend for the secret south the very next the drill break through into the hollowed-out of the bolshevik in london not expect it could be complete until the follow weekend the british fleet still out of the which the insert down through the long hole neutron bomb when it inside the confine of the huge the effect be the intense kill everyone inside the the effect of the bomb believe to the ship inside sufficiently to them cosmospheres be converge on the ship which be the order from the ship be invisible to the eye due to their protective shield which protect but they be sit duck for the which the employ the cosmospheres the seven ship use their psychoenergetic equipment know prf i report in the there be no method know by which prf be the cosmospheres the of the ship to the the sub be with non-homing torpedo design to explode on more torpedo would be throw off course or by the protective shield of ship but these simple torpedo just cruise right through invisibility field to strike the ship explode within minute the seven bolshevik ship be on their to the bottom with them go their bolshevik crew collect from the world the south take just sunset time the time here in even of see briefly in public with the new british foreign minister pym pym the pseudo-smile which to in public but not grin from to no wonder the joint be success the secret bolshevik south fleet be wipe out bottle up inside south the south fleet while not wipe out be cripple by work together the rockefeller the win the secret of the southern hemisphere topic i these word news report give the impression be to erupt in the south but the in the southern hemisphere be over we now be the begin of it bloody be the for the they be promise to for her role in the secret this moment the bolshevik here in press for public the unite will side with soon will up the no choice but to fight she suffer which not be without public but by fight the bolshevik in run the risk of for the the rockefeller here now on on side now we the movement there publicity of kind to u to the terror of in recent month there even be pop up on election with the issue doctor together to the public would if there be we be tell this be just pop up we now into the nothing like this ever so much momentum before yet now we suppose to believe million of get the the time if you believe my friend i give up movement like this never i never develop without money plenty of it we be the rockefeller public work i in the the rockefeller not to let if it doe they will lose everything they not in position to control it the enemy of the rockefeller the bolshevik here will win out if there be so the rockefeller be now do everything in it power to prevent the present of the rockefeller common interest between them but new ruler know very well this doe not spring from perspective on the of the rockefeller group it purely of necessity right now for the rockefeller the the unite house divide they exploit division by work in with the rockefeller their first priority be to rid the world of the bolshevik of even but once be do they know there will be of reckon with the rockefeller some the rockefeller group be work definite objective with their new objective be renew power power move them closer to their old of world government the bolshevik here unwittingly provide fertile grind for the powerful new rockefeller under bolshevik control the become so it people the rockefeller be design to on tool of power these the smell of be in the the crisis be help to more intense the rockefeller be now the for the surrender of sovereignty be the only to new super-united of sort be now in the work to fill the bill it will teeth presently envision the new will be in the work though this be be the world council the be to bring it into be the outgrowth of but it true purpose will be to use the of to control u minute now it time for my minute in this letter i report on the behind the crisis the crisis erupt of secret bolshevik-controlled in the southern hemisphere these be by joint of the rockefeller the in to slow down the the be successful but the result to be see one result though be the now be into well be my friend two struggle for control over our unite the rockefeller the bolshevik they differ in style but both seek to control u through if we ever to rise their trickery it must be through the power of our lord jesus christ our only hope the scripture tell u our lord not give u the spirit of but of power of love of sound mind we must to our lord long bless the for they be son of god until next month god will this be dr beter you god bless every one of
