from subject re re fillibuster in phill write in write in phill write in write well yes no the it be therefore difficult to determine precisely etc be up to from them there couple of to look them one be we you to support this constitution so we we think will to you or the more this be why we think we suggest in this constitution be good you consider the former to be the the point be they do not to point out where the consitution be the new yorker interest they do not to opposition by their on principle horror to principle we the question of whether the constitution might be write to to the principle you to believe it write with something else in mind put out by it supporter but let be honest something here when the time you bring up the point your own or they simply we know phill he obviously use design to convince well i know dye in the wool the extreme to jefferson impules but would you suggest of determine their opinion on the government if we do consider they write the government i do propose exist for determine their true opinion thus their true opinion die with them of little help their opinion not the slightest on the though only their these true or of who them or why if they true or of why they be why on do you point of them would seem to be irrelevent the difficulty most u poster seem to be in consider their be or no longer to modern society oh i no with question them i do believe they no longer but i think most of them be good i not entirely the they be obviously only to minority of the time but i do think be sufficient to them if they be the one opinion we could count upon these men to express be study of the of government be ongoing improvement of the be require they their opinion in be prove right in other they get it wrong they ensure there to improve the consititution this only if there be willingness to the problem within the u system require solution since the constitution be the for the system most in it would require in this however the fillibuster be of procedure it only should be of the constitution if the le powerful the house of lord we to the house of in they both be the british government much power do the system in principle no in yes in principle no they le power of they should le power the british government be dependent on the will of the by convention seek to exercise power be depose the subtly be the prime minister be not to identify their politics with the interest in the u president do phill we discusing the power of house while the prime minister be member of he be more to the president now to me how the house of be in principle more powerful the house of lord or the but in be le you suggest the writer of the constitution intend for them to be more powerful but gosh the thing before they they forget to put those restriction on the in i the system be not too slow it simply design to le it it somebody in put it whose i forget congress become everybody city council one for be every level the government be render to come to decision these decision push up to the next higher level not entry level science course will tell you people who implement will choose the level of government to which present them with the best of get they with interest group it be simply very thing to do to the government to the le people to le contribution to why do those concern the level simply if they win the little win by extension the extend to medicine most other question government not in it do it should but it be by interest thus interest who to by their rule get their rule the government thus since they get more clout only in the wrong they to the next higher level it impose it will on the lower i let get here do we need the congres of the unite decide x light should be on thus such or need to be oppose to crime the more people the more congress will power to sell it to them for their vote i do think the rise of interest be coincidence with the power of congress congress be more of quick more enough power time on it if it confine itself to it jurisidiction more if they be to from model of the current no subsidy motto they would be better it be there be plenty of money be out the problem be it be distribute on the of power in congress not on the of need bingo the higher up the the le need power be higher level while people with le cloud only find themselves reduce to in effectiveness in order to set up school project in new york you to off the other with pork defense subsidy etc or to be precise of the since you need to the filibuster then why not simply new york to new york i unconcinved there be in the union which be not of it own child if they to do if you it to them you only to worry the pork in since industry their power they must divide it the to try get they voice more the problem with the fillibuster be not you must buy off but the congress too much power to sell pork it be not of the system of government they but it be under set of condition they to of power it would seem then the proper thing to do be not to reduce the power of either house in some to the wheel you get then be system which move quicker to do stupid thing it would more sense to more decision level no you to the free of before you redirect it but why on should we to redirect it you yourself you to sell pork to get thing through congress if congres le to sell pork it to within it jurisdiction the pork problem be reduce the current block on power simply congress of responsibility to come to decision the current block be to thus it the system be weight consider the government the the institution with the sole power to enforce it decision by force i consider those decision good thing push the decision lower in the wo work unless the lower level le corrupt in most they worse not better the difference with the lower be they more in most under our constitution the government b those lower level power be to c you get the benefit of not impose new deicisons on everybody once you get to see them try out without decision the entire country whole yet even with problem in different different solution be for while i often do with the decision my rep i better option of go to the city council shoot my mouth off i much the of be by people who end up to put up with them somebody off in with million or more constituent i curious you your lower level more corrupt i to see where restriction imply or otherwise be on the veto it could just be to put check on but unwise in the executive opinion policy since we be from the i would point to them phill you bring up the we be the fillibuster whether or not minority of should be to hold up bill you the suppose to be le powerful house i contend there nothing in the constitution or other write which this which when you bring up we decide the founder on the you them i never from them i refer to the constitution which only very restriction on the for the house the u constitution give no to how it should work the only where be give be the right to where the well be the constitution be document the of independence the high-brow there couple of other though such the for the power to the for the power to permit both in i section the veto to be follow from the of the if the president to revise then there would be three of the not two furthermore the of power would be much le distinct to extend i do believe the veto become something it intend however i believe it be consider the congress own of their power to bill they them to unlike most people i think we should be worry the veto which be fine but of the problem in congress which it there be no limit in the constitution to the president veto power bill be for previous president use the veto for number of most something to do with their i curious how you single bush out the president who veto he the record for veto bush phill bush veto one of which over-ridden go up on fdr if you think resemble record why be it not restriction be the holy number upon which must be if feel enough with their constituency to up fillibuster be enough to there sufficient question to whether be good or not to it up to point the be though when the oppose by minority the minority should not be to win by why not be inherently wrong with the system governemnt in the when with issue with minority minority not be successful when you in position of impose power on diverse people why should the government not to get through something more why one should be sufficient to which cover million people in very very diverse live in different condition why be require the bill issue be money bill to short term now we switch from question of fillibuster to specific bill i do see how it difference it be not in the where presupposition in of the quo be sure it it however require to bring it to vote ensure they to good something be solely on line system in which the simple be give power to ignore the minority then the minority will be ignore i do not see this positive thing for i sure the look for pork much the they get some objection to the in question so you consider system under which the minority win to be superior no i completely with system which require minority for since history be history of up group implement on minority i feel minority should sufficent clout to prevent they feel strongly enough be tiny minority i do the minority be of but i see no problem with the system univ of tenn div of cont info service group i still remember the you the your push me down the i begin to think you do love me weird
