from december subject re economics note ted direct followup to only while i respect his right to do so my own opinion followup-to field mere suggestion not this issue be of sufficient b civil liberty interest to keep it in well for this round in uh no not in boomer in boomer the judge do the to the cement by multi-million to be shut down over in require the to the the to them whole the would never be shut down the would just settlement the would prefer to the shut down while the would prefer le the of the to the continue in everyone property right be protect the be whole settlement cost be now here my of boomer on the present in the new york court of hold boomer v note the new york court of be the highest court in new york while the unite of the fifty their highest court supreme court supreme court or supreme court of new york theirs simply the court of to worse new york it second-highest court the supreme court division cement co h boomer et own the cement the give no to which first the of the or he of production their cement in the course of it the cement do injury to the property dirt smoke from the the seek injunctive relief be they the court to order cement to stop their property this seem entirely to me boomer own their property right to quiet enjoyment of it cement be deprive boomer et of right of the request for injunction the court order them to the be do to their property provide cement them in in other word the court cement co the power to the right to quiet enjoyment of their property by eminent by eminent be even when it do by the firm to do it be in my opinion wrong yes i know the boomer court do it eminent but if it like eminent swim like eminent like eminent let me issue with the you present the you in boomer the judge do the to the cement by multi-million to be shut down over in pull out edition of money or property under to do bodily to injure property to of crime or to expose defect this crime be commonly include under extortion how do you define one of the right to set it own price for unique piece of property which it own which express interest in buy or of the right not to sell property price i see it boomer et find themselves in the position of own something which cement to if it to in business every right in the world to set price they there be or should be you to be nice guy in your business you go on to the would never be shut down the would just settlement the would prefer to the shut down while the would prefer le the of the to the continue in if so so since when the court suppose to be in the business of prevent from settlement from other when those settlement from wrongful by those other if cement do to to choice between settlement or go out of business well should cement think of before go into business i note the show boomer et be not the responsible for bring this cement own for choose to build the type of they do where when they do then you everyone property right be protect the be whole settlement cost be i dispute your the be whole they be in by court deprive of their right owner of property to choose to sell or not sell property price to them for they be not whole i since when the court suppose to be in the business of ensure settlement cost if so i be i think the court be suppose to be in the business of ensure justice be do be boomer be if it be i to see how it le completely sensible you should the economics stuff of filter through who do like it for boomer be not be not my school doe very good job of hire for their such tort where i first encounter boomer instructor who of their opinion do the when the student get into their second third in which the student pick choose which course to except for the responsibility of course b presume to be bite more worldly self-confident le likely to be consciously or sub-consciously by school professor to from openly instructor be by them the instructor tend to be more open in express their own opinion this be true of instructor who in life or sit judge this be very sometimes more so be by cloister end of i it my opinion of it for the i i believe it to be triumph of something i only economic correctness over justice it be completely sensible only if you believe the right of the owner of cement to in business lose lot of their own money due to their own wrongful the right of hundred cement employee to not their job should trump the right of people who own property which by cement wrongful if you believe it be correct for the court or other of government to to the right to other people property by eminent you like posner bill he i do know if he to like boomer of course he too much of to ever be by president wo like his or wo like his support of if bright student shiver they do it to how the press will it up i see mike godwin posner economics be to everything be the when posner precisely the opposite so it go i my of the field refer to economics be if it the use of one of which court use to help them decision in in which the dispute by the of justice be evenly fine but by boomer it be not fine when the court view the economics of be more the justice of december
