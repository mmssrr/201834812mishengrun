very difficult decision very difficult he think she it well best she could q well doe he think it mr it just of word to friend q doe he think the mr the president q in retrospect mr the president by the decision of the enforcement the decision of the he full responsibility the time i think we to look to the future figure out do full review sure we do we to sure this doe this kind of thing doe or we know how to it q how much do he know she go to go with i know she the to him outline the for do she to him on precisely mr i do think it specific to go to i think they discussion the the of i think she note he few question just try to get sense of how thing be consider but it minute-by-minute of how the q well it we go in be it we go to use i mr i believe it we to go in some would the pressure on those in the compound hopefully spur them some sort of movement out q george there ever conscious decision or even discussion the president from mr not i we be in close with the justice the president responsibility for this the time i we just to be very very how this be we could be on how the decision be it be the responsibility of those on the grind to the control over this the president obviously responsibility for of this he by the q george there report on the television i do know more one of the member of the cult go into courthouse the fbi the fire not themselves there picture on the tv of into the build where the fire break out my question be be the white house this fire mr the evidence we be this fire by koresh those inside the compound every bite of evidence we q do the president the why do this now why this do he possible consequence of either or injury mr i do know the specific question he question how the decision go be q those question do he why now mr i think he you consider of the consequence you consider the i do know if he the question why now i do know if he specific question q do she tell him why now in term of the stuff come out since then the provide by the listen device koresh get more violent mr i not how much specific they get into i know she this be the she to i the decision she to it on the she receive from the field intensive question of those involve i do not know how precisely it beyond q be the president why one of the people who go into the compound couple week out over the weekend with some he tell enforcement people something this why mr this be the first i i think we go to be the fbi the there be those inside the compound be some it the break down it the judgment of the expert involve in the the not go to get better there some concern over the of the themselves who be work long beyond the time these to work the there some concern over the they do not in who could in for them there concern over the of these into they consider the of number of psychologist other expert on koresh those in the compound i would just go to the you to the best judgment you give the you the time they do obviously we regret the loss of life it terribly we wish it could turn out differently but doe from the judgment be the time q george when do the president know they be go to use it before the on the compound mr i just do know i do believe he give lot of on how the would go i just do know q point george you whether the present to the president by the to end the one or the other mr i think it present to the pressure on those in the compound we hop to move some of those out bring it in it present tomorrow be this be it q be the president he this to decision b reno the to decision mr oh i think he they be on the best the best they he not second-guess it in q george there between between the president the in other word they speak they do until clinton get from dinner mr i think likely yes q do he her time do she there between when she him i he dinner when she mr no no no i think he her night i could to it but i believe he her night he just to to her q go on mr not i know of no q do you know the now everyone perish who except eight or nine do you know of the other mr i do know more the fbi report in q cnn or how he keep of be go on if he to his how he keep of go on here i with due respect to cnn be how he do it mr no there i people in the white house be in with their justice to the full complete q who be those i it webb hubbell how the president be keep inform not mr i believe in with webb i speak with people the justice i believe bruce lindsey speak with people the justice either bernie or vince in different time during the with people the justice we be fully brief fully inform q we be tell this morning the president speak he speak with webb do you know if true or not mr i think there he i do believe he do but i think there he some point i do believe he do i think the he during the directly with the justice the phone with the but the white house fully inform on minute-to-minute of in the justice q george who decide the brief would be do by the mr the q do you or do the white house be you ever involve with decision mr no we be tell it q do you her to go on nightline lehrer stuff of mr no q there no from the white house her she on night mr yes she do very good job q why do you decide to the president to the be only write which be the white house of the president from the issue not him mr well the intent i we to we to until we of the the president be the president morning the president be fully involve q this turn into le successful the only from the president on the give to the in this mr well it the first from the president not the only from the president number one q the mr number two well the first number two the q he in the morning when the thing to move mr right he one he give one now the second point q it just this write with no sort of policy or think process involve it the president to put out write mr know we know the time we think it for the president he think it to put out write express his regret express his support for the q why it not for him to do something mr well he do do so be his it under his q george during the brief you do the president take full responsibility for mr i do q no you mr just not right q well i think you go to the i unless i miss something mr i love to q reno she take full responsibility you she the decision the fbi mr the president responsibility q take responsibility right mr check the q consider how little know go on inside the compound even now how little be know why be this suicide mr well i think know we know now give of the of koresh before during it be those there be under his control q it stretch it little bite where the kid concern though be it george mr i think be entirely different i i think koresh must responsibility for the of those child but he intent on some kind of incident he do q you still completely on right i you no evidence or you know of no evidence this suicide mr we evidence those inside the compound set fire to the compound which lead to the of those inside q i do quite it this might be question i do quite it but time do clinton himself put out on this i know dee dee some stuff on this but the president put out mr q right the even news go on the mr no right when we the we be work on it q dee dee confirm this morning the the president be go to be go to be why not someone from the outside to sure it not color by those who would those the whose be mr i think the the justice will responsibility for the not to rule out be often in like this some sort of independent involvement well but it will be run by the justice q you confident you will not problem get mr q george do the president out to else to get the meet with reno who else in the white house in on meet else from justice mr i do believe else there the time it phone on it meet q mr it phone it meet i believe he might be there with bruce but beyond i think he just to the q george you in phone she we to go in you will force him out do he think she if he do know his of he mr i think he to the pressure on it do how she do mr no no i q do he in term of how this would proceed he would to know not minute by-minute but in sense mr i think he know this the of those on the grind the of the enforcement i just do know q be this when you this the mr the to pressure i do know he tell whether he go to be tell the go to go up to the leave punch hole in the window or whether he just tell they be move in would the pressure i just do know q it to him not though q reno present him with her best they should go with he would mr he he do some question the he the time i would this on the of the enforcement involve q george it would seem this question just in the president inform the of the be go to come up here elsewhere you question mr yes q get the come to u with of it mr yes q you tell u there never meet session where you others decide we will put out write from the president we will reno be on of these television mr never never q you never the justice to or reno you the one who need to be out front this mr not once q it just she the no one ever bill session until mr she decision it for her the officer in the person who the decision to go out the question on this incident q she no from the white house mr we do object q but do you no i sure you do object but do you suggest it this mr no not q mr no q do she it mr no q do she notify you mr we know it q to this process you for to every public officer every under every rock every in government something this could occur without discussion between you the public people the justice mr the the decision the to go it seem like good decision it good decision she do good job q let me it this george if in hindsight how you would it mr i think it very well q you would thing if mr q the the white house of it from to finish mr well i think question we go to review one of the for the be to look for in the future something like this see we from incident like this see we how to them if you the issue of the press conference no there would q two question first of on her go on tv no white house people or outside up with this it just very reminiscent of you guy do during the mr how so q i think of like clinton on nightline the story clinton on mr there no there enforcement incident the incident end in of people the involve in decision the the decision to do she felt it her responsibility in the interest of public to go out the question of the press in order to sure of the question be she do job q the second question be do someone who know clinton well you do you why it sort of to believe he might not some question she intend to do in other word she she i go to put pressure on them it not to see clinton who intelligent inquisitive how q kind mr both the he do question he do question i do minute-by-minute of the q how long mr i think it minute q telephone mr yes q george the cost of this ever in term of step up the pressure mr i do believe so no q george you keep the president full responsibility but then you refer to it her decision doe the president not the it be his decision mr i do know this to do with this enforcement not he responsibility for the decision of the enforcement involve in his government i i think there just no q but be he it his decision well hers or be he it her decision there difference mr of it her decision he do not object to decision he full responsibility q george this brief go on just little over minute you see lot of thing be do they spend minute if it just very long period of time in phone mr it be long phone it very phone i think brit we the question i i would q one of the thing reno night be the buck stop here i think her direct doe the president with in this mr the president he full responsibility i think the be she decision she go to the responsibility come to her she not shrink from but neither be the president q point in the night between the president the or this morning do she ever offer her mr not to my knowledge q even before the fire out there be some on hill for be the white house concern the time of those request try to out of this mr no i do to question the motif of those who request we we full complete q in forum will you brit question will you put out write will you the wire how will you the question you mr i just not sure q george you remind u the president do where he meet he involve in mr i to try remember he series of meet with different member of the during the he monitor the in get periodic report on well he do see some on cnn well i believe he of the fbi press brief well q those report would come to him from would they do you think mr to him bruce to him i to him q george to follow helen question in their this morning do they discus her night in response to the question whether she would resign do he i do know why you felt the need to i here to you you do to do this do come up mr i do know if it even up i know the bulk of the discuss where do we go from here form the q the do her kind of comment night mr well i believe she question q her response if the president me to i will mr which would be i think the response most member would give i it q need to whether whether the president her mr i do know if they it i i the it the itself this just do come up i do not the question if they q will you with the brit mr q george for the record doe the president her to resign i know dee dee this morning mr not he support reno she good she do good job she difficult extremely well q george doe the president feel he reno be let down by the from the enforcement expert on the grind mr no the president be not second-guess decision those in be not to he doe regret the loss of life everybody regret the loss of life in this but the best judgment be in difficult on the best we q george the the one on be correct mr yes q how long the one morning mr i do know i question too q be these outside expert they be consult with or expert within the the fbi mr you to them i just not sure i know there be expert q why be there for these people be the unit mr i think it be very unit but i think it one of the kind of thing the will q george be there here involve the fbi director president when he to get doe only the i know the of but president to their fbi director in this throughout this entire siege he not felt he could pick up the phone to bill session who be from get expertise from him on to do not to do mr i think he to the fbi director well in the begin of the when it first break out in the time the the responsibility he get fully brief from the q do you think the director session be in some on the the president be brief on the of this evolve mr not i it perfectly he be brief by the the supervisory over the fbi director follow the of the press you end edt
