they troop on the grind there but i do not think we should nor do i think we will to in the next i think we will the extensive review which be go on which lot of my time well the time of the it should over the or so i think we finish in the future then we policy we it everybody it q i follow up the president sure q do you see between the ethnic in the the president i think the be on whole different level i think it be without precedent or peer in history on the other ethnic be the kind of the take to the nth degree the of move people them often kill them solely of their ethnicity be thing it be troublesome in where people of different ethnic group live side by side for so long together i think you to up it i think it wrong we be of the other trouble in region i to see the violence between the the muslim in subside this morning i think we progress on front but go on with the the ethnic be different the other conflict both within the former in other of the region q mr president by count you not good week in your presidency the in the of your stimulus bill the in do you do wrong you go to do differently how do you look thing you the president i do believe the in it not be good week for the world but i do know the could it different on the stimulus i like to put it into the context remind you in this we the direction of government we trickle-down economics we the policy bring the debt of this country from trillion to trillion in only the budget which the congress which will reduce the deficit investment lead to low in lower interest there people in this room who their home in the three month or who to credit go to put ten of billion course throughout this economy in very very good for the country so we move in the right direction i regret the stimulus do not i begin to will continue to not only people in the but people in the congress whether there be something i could do differently to of the it do politics of it difference in there people still who believe it not need i just with i think the recovery the economist it be for two we still month of seven percent unemployment the country trouble job so i think there there while we for the lower interest the deficit reduction the investment of the next four to effect this sort of should go now i to tell you i do of the now sit in the vote for stimulus when president in vote time for like this i just it i hope i something i just be here you know i governor work with contentious for it take me to get reform there so it time to thing but i feel very good in the first with to the congress q the president well with to i do much to to i i think it be i the look into i u to bring in people who insight to on i think it very the whole thing be thoroughly go over but i still i from the begin the offender there koresh i do not think the unite government be responsible for the bunch of decide to kill themselves i sorry they kill their child q mr president to follow up on helen on your stimulus on your to hill ross perot you with the people in your policy he strongly of your stimulus he he go to the north free how you go to his criticism will it your effort on the hill with your economic do you to some of the thing be in your stimulus try to resubmit them to the hill the president let me question first we go to revisit of over the next few i go to be to member of congress to others to see we do with to the economic i must i find i do to get into with mr perot i be interest to his specific but i would go his book his there convergence except we more specific budget cut we le on the middle more on the but otherwise the so i think it would be i be interest to see if he his position from his book he some new to bring to i be to them q to follow up sir how do you to his criticism he you do you think you sit just the president well first of i will you to the level of scrutiny to him you do to me if he his position from the position he take in the then we need to know why his he get some constructive i think the people show they very with people who do to produce result the one thing i think everybody figure out me in the even if they do with i do be i to get something do i just here to try to thing i to do thing i to do thing help people life so my judgment be if he suggestion be good be constructive u beyond some i propose will people life for the better fine but i think ought to be the test we to everyone who weigh into this not just to the president q mr president to go to for minute you continue to insist this to be seem to u when it come to option thus it look if this be of the unite be the superpower why be it not in this for the unite to the president well the unite surely you would the unite even the superpower to consistent with under some of the unite q but you the president they do be one of the thing we under review i rule out option for i would remind of you i not rule out option except we not discuss we not consider the introduction of force into continue hostility there we not so we review other option but i would remind you to be our the french the british the troop on the grind there they be worry those but they support the the toughen of the they welcome the now in europe work on how to these work bite i tell you the other involve genuinely their position i would not rule out the we for concert go beyond where we be i do criticism of the british the french others q would be q mr president of the light in your from your fbi director to your to your deputy budget director to your service issue in the couple of week which to some of the position you in your why be you lose your grip the president give me q judge session there no child in in this morning she strike in of these thing you you do support the president first of i do know we know koresh sex with child i think be undisputed be it not be it not doe dispute where i come from child we know he people these kid how to kill themselves i think i not judge session i do know he in term of no public strike there be press report she write me letter in which she express her or memo in which she express her view the new direction we should in response to my request to the senior member of my to let me know they think we ought to do next i from her from others they think we ought to do next i not go to discus the they to me but in the next few when i decision to do then i will i go to do so i would either one of those out of school q how the mr president the president q the mr rivlin miss both they think good the president i do mind them they think it good there kind of for it on policy grind doe not we decide to it in the no decision be on i no objection to their express their view on we lot of people from business come to u they think would help their industry more competitive in the economy i take no line policy q mr president week group of out of meet with you express in the most ring term their confidence in your of them their their belief you would fulfill those do you feel now you will be to meet their now the president well i do know i do know their it depend on the but i tell you this i believe this country policy should be in of i believe when you tell people they do thing in this country other people do there ought to be overwhelm compel for it i believe we need the service of of our people i consistently not proposition the first time this issue up in when i in boston i just the question it i might it interest i be obviously those who with me here come from the right in when i governor i from the other direction for stick up for the right of religious to run their child center to home school under i just view we should try to protect the right of to live up to the fullest of their i go to stick right with q you concern sir you on their end criticism others your in the sense of too on this issue the president yes but i not of on it it get lot of in other in the press i just simply my position try to see it through i do it doe lot of my time president to i believe in i intend to do i continue to do q mr president get to the in we you decision on new option previously consider but the two most commonly option would be lift the to the muslim to defend themselves to some limit strike to cut off supply line without tell u your decision you decision on those two option the pro con go through your mind right now will weigh on your decision the president i to get into this there those two of the option there some other option be consider plus minus supporter opponent within the in the congress where i would remind you will be require to on new policy i do believe on the strike issue the pronouncement powell there if you if the unite we must objective be meet we must be to it it must be the unite be not should not become involve in with to the lift of the the question obviously there be if you widen the of people to fight will help to get settlement bring will it to more bloodshed kind of others would undermine the effectiveness of the policy but i think both of them deserve some serious with some other option we q do you think these people who try to get u into in remember we of hundred of of from the we could of our prisoner get them home from now of them come up with bill for of how we to go to more of these the president well i think good the unite itself become involve belligerent in there but we the world only super power we do to the world there be very serious problem of ethnic in the former which could not only enormous further consequence goodness know there be but could other consequence in other region where the sort of ethnic tension exist q do you kind of with boris yeltsin to hold off either on strike or kind of the serb until in how his your on the president no i not he do not for we never even discuss interestingly enough the i would remind you in the middle of president yeltsin from our to get tougher through the unite in i think the proper decision for them one the unite i sure the rest of the free world very much q do you wish mr president you become more involve in the of the how would you differently now the president i do think the president should become involve in the of those kind of thing one of the thing i sure will come out when we look into this be the question will be do of u who up the line of the question we should get the we should get i look to but the time i to i do before the first thing i do the be kill once we know the fbi go to go in to the be consult of the of the conflict give the resource koresh in his compound their obvious willingness to use them then on the before the i the question of the which i report to you previously which the time i think be sufficient i i i sure i it to others to the suggestion whether there other question i should q mr president be your of director session role in the you decision on his future if you will you give him before you do decide the president well first of i no of his role since i no direct with him i no or positive inference i no there i by i before my high for the fbi i for from the to do with the direction of the fbi q mr president since you one side in conflict represent the to the nth degree why do you then tell u the unite not view in this the president well i the principle of ethnic be something we ought to up doe not the unite or the unite enter in effect to the line line of republic within or would be successful i think the unite to do be to try to figure out whether there be some consistent with force the people to resolve their own difficulty we up to stop ethnic be obviously the difficulty we wrestle with this be the most difficult foreign policy problem we of our if it be i suppose it would be solve before we try to do more in the previously do it not be enough to stop the we now look else we do q you the roosevelt for not bomb the to the thing be there step like would not involve conflict direct conflict or belligerence you might consider the president there be i would remind you the be different we be then with the time whole incident so series of incident so perplex but we i we get of our option under review q the on be on the verge of you do to it short of the president well you know something i do not our people tell me i think mr do together good job the thing keep go forth of the people who involve with the de government there it obvious their concern they be the concern lead to the ouster of in the first president we feel should be restore to power we work i get report on we discus it three time week i convince we go to there be successful i do believe there every to think there will to be some sort of presence to try to the security the freedom from violence of people on both side of the ledger while we try to the condition of ongoing society but i believe we go to there q mr president would you to your of the first before we one for you the president well i if i believe first of we the budget resolution in record time the biggest issue confirm the direction of the confirm the commitment of the we could both bring the deficit down investment we could do it by specific spend cut by of which come from the highest income people in this society reverse trend in which most of the burden be bear by the middle whose income be go down when their be go up while the deficit go from trillion to trillion the debt the deficit continue to go up we low in interest from we lower interest the we ten of billion of flood into this economy people their debt we new policy which be different the of work with me with others with the governor to new in focus on tough well opportunity we do enormous of work on reform on lobby reform i impose tough ethic requirement on my own these thing consistent with not only i i do in the but with turn the country the vice president be force which will the the government it much more responsive to the of this country we work on whole of other thing the reform to move people from to work of course of work be do on the issue which be huge economic security problem for million of so i think it be how much be do more will be do we the bill version of the motor voter bill not come out of conference to me yet everything be except the stimulus so i think we do fine we move in the right direction i feel good it q sir follow-up would you though one of your biggest to soviet be now finish if we stimulus bill in our own country how we do it for them the president let me the question little bite it good question it good question but to be we get to it we the first round of to the soviet to non-soviet to be go to go through the first billion the we with our in the to provide through the institution which be big item be go to go through the question be we get more for require new by the unite congress be question i think will be resolve in the week in by to the worker their job their future i think the two thing will be tie by member of congress q the report out this morning document horrendous conduct on the of the how much do you discus the incident might be do it with your nominee to be the of the the president first let me comment little on the inspector report conduct which be wrong which no in the service i expect the report to be on in the i to to the people to of you the report should be for it be very disturb list of which will to be thoroughly it should not be indictment of the unite or of the fine people who serve there it be very specific in it it will be pursue the only thing i to the of the the only thing i should to him i think be i expect him to the report to do his duty i believe he will do q mr president to to for just minute the poll show mr yeltsin will win his vote of confidence but there seem to be toss-up on whether or not voter go to endorse his economic reform the president i q you live with split you live with split decision though or do you need both in order to then build support for the president i believe the to your question be for the unite the key question should be which be pose to which be who win the election if he win the election if he be by the people to continue their president then i think we should do our best to work with him reform you know we lot of other country here for the museum their be here from europe from one republic of the former soviet union of them terrible economic they convert from communist control economy to economy in world where there economic slowdown everywhere in world in which there economic slowdown difficulty will trouble their policy be in poll they produce the result the people so for you but if they confidence in the i think we the unite will if the people him their president stick with him then the unite will continue to work with him i think he be genuine d genuinely commit to reform i think we should support q mr president mr perot come out strongly in be perceive behind the line free how you go to fight for this free when do you expect to see it the president i think we the in the future you know our people still work with the government with the on the side we try to work out the will the will then the to with enforcement be the there be some merit to their position they worry their sovereignty in enforcement to commission even in the unite to be we some folk who worry give up on the other if we go to something then there to be some consequence for them so we try to do be to on which would if there be of if you keep on it point not incident but of there be go to be some enforcement there must be consequence we work out the of but i still feel quite good it this be just where i with mr perot with others i think we will win big if we more closely the economy the economy u from there to chile to other economy in give u bigger world in which to i think the only rich country grow richer if you look other country in the do to out in their own region it pretty good lesson to u we better worry how to build those bridge in our own so this be you know you get lot of question i to them but let me not every one of these thing be distil simply into politics you know who for this who for if this person be for this somebody else get to be for lot of these thing honestly involve over over who right wrong the world which we move the not self-evident one of the i to run for president be i to sort of open the for these so we could try to in the so i just difference of opinion i believe the concept of be sound even though you know i think the need to be improve q mr president there tremendous flurry of interest this month in the document purport to show the hold prisoner vessey now publicly while the document itself he belief it incorrect do you view this point issue more do you believe in the do return the prisoner the time of the the president first let me i vessey before he go to he return i high for him i his willingness to serve his country in this to whether the document in let me the government of more forthcoming it be in the u some document would tend to undermine the of the document i do not know whether be right or wrong we it this time when we complete the we tell you of course we to tell the of those who be miss in or who be pow i think we be to some progress in some of the question the result of this but i not i fully we know we need to know there still some we do know the to but i do believe we some progress i by the trip q i like to follow up on before the to go do you to be sure every be resolve or would you be will to go on the while it to resolve these the sufficient offer to u to confirm good the president lot of expert you never resolve every every one we could resolve the for them there still some not be resolve go to the second world but i would to be convince of be we go long resolve every could be resolve this moment in time there complete open unrestricted commitment to continue to do everything could be do to keep resolve those we not there yet i to be guide little bite by people who know lot this i confess to be much more influence by the of the people whose life be lose there or whose life in question by the interest the other thing which seem so compel in this moment i just very influence by how the feel q your economic stimulus you do some kind of check now some of your your for the come include the crime bill the other thing there to do do you the power of bob dole the president no i the extent to which i think self-evident we below the spend by this congress include the who be in this congress when we budget resolution which for over billion in deficit reduction when they vote for to help foreign government i think four of them would vote to cloture i i do not of with i think if i effort to to compromise it would not be rebuff every time i offer something they reduce the offer they previously be to the so it set of event but i think of our but not the of it get out of proportion to the merit so lot of be to me mr president i like to be for this but i now we string out we divide i think we need to do check i i to know let me go to i i to know from our folk from our friend in the on or be could i do differently to it come out differently the loser here be not the president the the loser be the hundred of of people who wo job now we could put kid to work this summer i we could do lot of good thing with money i think be very very it more it should but the underlie i do think hold lot of it deficit spend just wo q redo the president no i you know for you mention the crime bill i think it would be not to the crime bill i the crime bill on the point of they be fight over the bill surely surely we be through in this country just in the three month with the kind of mindless violence we see we bill require people to go through period before they buy surely we see we need more police officer on the street thing i believe once we move some of money not but some of it up into this job to some of the job rehiring police officer on the street who be off would be compel i people in this country i think we need to go i feel very strongly we need to go on the crime bill q mr president to the report for second report very strong criticism of the senior in but do not of the senior officer do you believe the senior officer who in this include kelso who there one night in should they be discipline do you believe the public right to know the of the senior officer the president you should know under the rule of which to this i in the of there be now inspector report the must it course if i be to question i might prejudice decision which might be in this i do think i think i tell you be i i very disturb by the specific in the inspector report i to be until the proper procedure to kick in be i be i the i to be very i so not to prejudice the right of whom might proceed or to prejudice the in other either pro or con so i more except to i this thing in thorough q mr president could i you for on you you be not consider introduction of force doe include force well grind force sir the president i grind force q you grind force could i you sir if you use strike might the unite into grind there the president i just do to discus our of the option i tell you there never be serious discussion in this country the introduction of grind force into ongoing conflict there q with hundred of of in this weekend for the do you ever reconsider your decision to town for this weekend do you ever consider in in some of the the president no q why not the president i i would in other i think once you become president on except under be not should be do but more i go to the society of editor trip most of you would me to to try to focus on i think the issue for our country right now i expect i will something the lot of come here for be free of to be to work live by the rule be like other if they do just be my position not only for the who will be here but for others well you very much edt
