from december subject re economics i go to be mix together here stuff from two of ted which response to me response to tim smith yes i know the boomer court do it eminent but if it like eminent swim like eminent like eminent tort eminent then eminent be in which one be require to sell piece of property which it own to of whether the first wish to sell price which be set by the i to see how this doctrine be find in tort or in well sort of in if so so since when the court suppose to be in the business of prevent from settlement from other when those settlement from wrongful by those other since you boomer on economics lead to unjust result i point out your be more unjust in the sense of the world cement not wrongful it do something we society should them to do build industry job the cost of grossly to the by here one of the where we widely diverge you believe the court in decide civil dispute between two should consider override issue which i believe the court should ignore be to the dispute boomer v cement co bring by one boomer whose property right be be on ongoing by the cement the support boomer contention cement wrongfully his property boomer the court to order cement to stop do so end of story there no for the court to consider such issue society would cement to do or whether the cost of to the by the those issue nothing to do with the before the court bill if the government step in the require multi-million cement to be shut down of of cement dust cost-benefit of you be up in why be it for the to interfere this but not the or executive i be up in why do you quite the i support the since it would be on the doctrine the decision i believe would be correct in boomer the people property right should not be for of economic efficiency in boomer it boomer property right which i believe the court should protect in the rule you present it the people collective property right in environment good be cost-benefit of if you wind up with cement dust in your your rule it per se to ever cement if the of up with you be up in interference with property right fifth once why be it for the to interfere this but not the or executive or you not the you present yourself be ted how would it be per se to cement would it just when buy for cement you would to either buy enough so most of the pollution would on your or buy pollution from the surround tim smith it be one holdout out of hundred of neighbor to the furthermore of the neighbor be go to the full benefit of the under the result monopoly for to be sure who get to of these for homeowner who extort profit the would but not good for society yes so the court suppose to protect the specific right of not the interest of some nebulous society if society it cement without right fine otherwise society will somehow to limp with one le cement see ted i the whole point behind the theorem in world without cost the will be put to the best use it be from person to person without friction the regime will not the result will be the in world such ours one with cost one the regime to the end result to begin with in order to the cost one the regime to the end result to begin with in order to the cost which one you of i the regime to protect people right besides theorem only in the never-never of perfectly in the world some people go to be stubborn ornery spiteful or otherwise from economic point of view the purpose of the court be to protect their right to be so i do if you show me your only do of to my property per so i should sell you right to my for per i still the right to tell you i just do on my property not price then you everyone property right be protect the be whole settlement cost be i dispute your the be whole they be in by court deprive of their right owner of property to choose to sell or not sell property price to them then by your no tort be ever whole the of in why should we different other tort we do require specific in the why in tort question first for the in to do so would come close to on the thirteenth to your then by your no tort be ever whole the of in you right with in which the wrong be do the to the victim not be reverse or undo court will try to set price on the loss suffer by the victim require the wrongdoer to this price price which the victim might prefer in these the be irreversible the court simply try to ensure price be under the doctrine only in should even civil wrongdoer be force to punitive or excessive price b even genuine victim should not profit in unjustified or from his victimhood both of these doctrine be worth discuss or elsewhere but neither be to like boomer in which the wrongful the loss stem from it still in the future be prevent from by order of the court in these type of the court to do be require the victim property right protect until unless he to sell them price there be no need for the court to guess the of the loss force both side to it find it up to the themselves i since when the court suppose to be in the business of ensure settlement cost if so i be i think the court be suppose to be in the business of ensure justice be do settlement cost unjust they punitive in like boomer they simply cost of do business the the proprietor of the cement co get themselves into position in which they find themselves over this be simply result of their own poor business decision to up cement without first try to with boomer everyone else whose property right they be the of their there nothing punitive or unjust it it be completely sensible only if you believe the right of the owner of cement to in business lose lot of their own money due to their own wrongful the right of hundred cement employee to not their job should trump the right of people who own property which by cement wrongful who ever commit wrongful should disgorge their entire set of possession to wrong person be you excess punitive before who to commit wrongful in the future should be require to buy the right to do so from the victim in the seller should be to set his or her price for the privilege no injustice no punitive you like posner bill he i do know if he to like boomer in he cite it of monopoly the court correctly i sure it cover in the posner book on tort but i do book in front of me doe sound very much like to me tend to believe in the right of people not society i my of the field refer to economics be if it the use of one of which court use to help them decision in in which the dispute by the of justice be evenly fine but by boomer it be not fine when the court view the economics of be more the justice of in this the justice of the tie up with the economics of the cement commit tort of should it in the million or just for the it commit the tort ongoing cement to be to continue to boomer right while the court be justify in set price on the commit it no no need to set price on the future of boomer right to then force boomer to sell price december
