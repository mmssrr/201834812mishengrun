from dp prutchi subject re long ir detection in sburton burton write i would like to be to detect the position low of ir emit source of meter more be better in the ir source could be emit i with duty cycle i consider the use of detector from centronic inc to give to to point the sensor thus determine the for the source i consider the heck out of ir lead s possibly optek or would current pulse this current the duty cycle of the lead drop to i would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the require do something like this burton sburton dre suffield box medicine method which will directly provide you with the you require be which be commonly use for of body eg the selspot system by selspot sweden the system these use photoeffect detector lindholm oberg woltring to determine the position of spot of light project use lens over it in escence the detector be photodiode with four one on of the four side of the detector single the of the spot of light will produce current which to the position of the spot on the detector let try some in so the detector two to detect position xxxxx xxxxx light xxxxx divider output xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx gnd xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx if the dot of light from the lead be the only source of light then the position of the projection be give by this circuit of the level of tion the divider be use to to receive power when this circuit be use in the presence of other source of light then the of tune to it be to for few msec the light the lead for time the difference between the two be the position of the lead photonics sell photoeffect detector they sell the require process electronics the system by selspot others not lindholm oberg optoelectronic instrument for remote on-line movement monitor biotelemetry woltring opto-electronic selspot ments in two three report bull pro thetics most this technique provide you with much more you need but i think it simplicity detector with system until you difference prutchi university prutchi box dp one brook drive st louis mo
