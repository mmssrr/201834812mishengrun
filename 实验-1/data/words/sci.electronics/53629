from lung subject re ic in write hi i look for some help in choose for high-speed silicon currently be this be phd project i to test the chip speed on pcb i expect to roughly circuit will do dc low-speed high-speed test use different set-ups for the test chip i know for sure dip will not work the long line too high get be too expensive so i try to choose between chip the would be to test since it to be solder on to the test setup i would spend of time solder i keep the test chip the chip socket long line not work high speed doe out there of this field i would help of would help the seem like bite of overkill you do mention whether or not cost be issue where you run the side ttl ecl we run over our ic test equipment long in the ecl we use dip with plcc pitch qfp to few i do see problem in long you to sound engineer good source of be mecl system design the ed be be consider to be one of the bible in high-speed design the very you need to build test fixture you most likely go to need socket it in itself more per pin the you test not to mention discontinuity i do see the big concern over the it be go to much difference if you try to get ttl to run fun ttl never design to run in environment my opinion nothing to do with my the
