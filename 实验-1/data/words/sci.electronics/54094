from dino tony subject re current limit collins write one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guy for our project we need to design build power supply to the follow spec from current limit must within of for i from ripple le mv rms of course we just use current-limiting chip our problem be with the current limit we find stuff to do the rest of the of the circuit the supply must do if present with which would more give the supply be reduce the so the current will one thus if we be to short the thing with the we should one if we the current through ohm resistor we should one the output by necessity must be the only we see for the current limiter involve circuit which will pull current off of the of the output power therefore reduce the output so doe we could work from in collins p if to this stupid project i fully but i still to do it it you design for shutoff current limit or even cutoff sound like you current limit your be correct to pull down the to the series drive in order to get the brick you need enough on the current sensor on the current sense resistor will be but for infinite use op to sense the current to reference use driver to turn off the on the be with this close loop control system if yopu more degree shift in your circuit unity ok dino the inquire mind bb winnipeg
