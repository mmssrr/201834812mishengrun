from kevin subject re decouple i use on-chip to reduce ground-bounce noise on systolic chip on the clock line design in n-well cmos use the mosis design rule here some think on the they do help much with output switch there be still between the the on both the line the grind return so you still get grind power line bounce they do help lot with on-chip i with the high on the clock line the you try to suppress high frequency so forget of poly-thin-oxide-diff since the rc time be too i do be to poly diff but put lot of hole in the poly frequent i forget how wide the poly line be if i be do this design i omit the diff use solid poly sheet use just poly but such high it be ignore these speed you better off try to tune your circuit to run with slightly slower edge lower swing for output spend chip on i on the die since the circuit too big for mosis tiny chip the next up twice big i need kevin kevin due to the light the end of the tunnel be be turn off
