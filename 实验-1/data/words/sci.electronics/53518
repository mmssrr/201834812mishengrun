from joel subject re dumb question function in glen write i new scope i think i few buck by buy one with function build in hmm now where for the i function offset the too high be there i could myself little box could solve this little problem the box would the function input lower the give output be some low number i would to lower the by of one hundred or so i could just build little buffer but i like to this box not be sure you get the right ignore the ohm of the for second just run it into divider of ohm in series with ohm this new circuit be the thevenin of one put out of the output impedence of negligibly le ohm you to monkey with the little depend on whether you more the divide or the of hows sound joel this be why those high probe for multimeters be but still they something like meg in series with which doe the often high impedence source much well keep the meg multimeter
