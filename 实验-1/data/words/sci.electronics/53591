from subject ic hi i look for some help in choose for high-speed silicon currently be this be phd project i to test the chip speed on pcb i expect to roughly circuit will do dc low-speed high-speed test use different set-ups for the test chip i know for sure dip will not work the long line too high get be too expensive so i try to choose between chip the would be to test since it to be solder on to the test setup i would spend of time solder i keep the test chip the chip socket long line not work high speed doe out there of this field i would help of would help the seem like bite of overkill
