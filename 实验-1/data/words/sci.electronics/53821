from tom of old equipment subject re suggestion on in lung write in billq billy quinn write i build little project use the to switch i get pretty when the thing switch i do most of the common thing one be suppose to do when use nothing seem to get rid of the click my question be be there good circuit i use for switch so there will be no noise of kind on the line i will or reference to etc for the will help you switch high level or low level like out level the click you mention the big when it switch or you refer to bounce how you drive the ttl output switch how the connect to you drive need more specific to your question rule no will switch if you try to the circuit with the the noise you be due to the open close of the the noiseless of be to grind the circuit in high circuit resistive t be construct close to of the circuit ground the imputs connect to the t the in low circuit use the input short out or ground the sometimes if it be to switch second be use to short the circuit output for the of the switch time telephone be to before but i see of these for switch be do with op etc novel circuit i use to build primitive it consist of resistive photocell in tube when the be off the cell be high turn the on the lower the once this device in t switch the the give remote volume control use resister you mixer lot of luck tom tom college british loc kentucky rifle to site rr british i do not recyle i keep everything
