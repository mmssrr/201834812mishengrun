from mr smith subject multiplier problem hi i just build use multiplier to step the supply up to the the rc hence the output drop i need high output possible the circuit consist of seven multiplier ie diode develop them i the output from seven be if i of the will the rc hence some of the problem these go to be little expensive i need of them so would if i connect in with the output hence in with the seven will it i the c in circuit hence the rc time if it doe my output become more by do this then i will kill two bird with one stone i experience some ripple hence hum this new will this out recomend for inductor choke to be in the output line of the power supply to filter out the hum lowest possible i not get my with me the moment it be too much of i university i get to get my finish in two week hence i not with my solderoing iron it be too in the long run if new do work the net in chris mr chris smith on uni liverpool university quest to build more more dgree computer science ever the sun be it be not of view express my own reflect of think
