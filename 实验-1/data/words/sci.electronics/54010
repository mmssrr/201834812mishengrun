from ggruscho george gruschow subject re how to the disk copy protect write in mblock block write in write i wonder copy protection technique how effective they experience in this with highest uh oh umm there number of copy protection scheme some involve modify the some involve encryption scheme c of the one exist over the course of compute be successful for time i however monthly of new to the copy protection scheme of the the be none of them completely secure or it some more or le difficult to some be i guess i be your question be difficult if not impossible to do you to know do you need good one for project you work on how secure must it be you try to one someone else use i suggestion the be strictly in it be to with copy protection it to corruption of file which you do not up of be they copy protect which be do you no for merely curious up those question i try to help much i the uh oh the top be of the who their friend equipment be off feel when they how to the you be work with of which include the or it from one side or the other i write i to it i would like degree of protection since my custmers not the i know hole burn method key method however my be go to cost only so i not this low price i not people too copy of my well i guess upto copy be ok by me however i do not someone to get copy of pctools copy my off course i never to forbid the true from copy since they develope better with highest one of the most method of course be the check where they you for word from x line y word but this be pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksum into the of your some self-rewriting code to confuse some people sure your not be run out debugger method of course be to not even sector on the disk just write key to sector to help you here you must do the code protection scheme mention in the first sure you fill the rest of the of the disk with well or they be just look for the junk in some sector like you mention there the hole disk key but they both expensive in the butt for the end-user which you be the opposite of you be use be to the of the it be be to in the most you think of if the doe not find this be the system it request be by the disk the disk should be encrypt sector should be check else you think of to sure the not be copy once you must put code-encryption self-rewriting code multiple crc check in the to sure it doe not get other thing this protect your from virii if the detect in it code tell the user virus be detect in the tell them the be virus secure remember you help the world kill some kill some virus feel good i hope i help fun knock some out well you do it everything be write be but you off in the process goodbye be the will be sell george gruschow do you gronk ggruscho
