from glenne glenn elmore subject re single chip receiver for fsk john x write my next project be to come up with module for to use no scheme just wide fsk for use or i bite with the chip but i wonder if there newer design might work higher input frequency my be to come up with inexpensive design for receiver end with if input on one end fsk on the other i interest in to use higher if do current chip work up to with downconversion so if filter be use suggestion john you describe be very close to i build describe in the computer network conference proceed i build fsk they double conversion with mod demod the receiver us the which be the fsk receiver chip i use previouslyu in the mbps link i first publish in which be now in the the which include vhf converter section could be use these speed there be newer slightly improve design of this the if i remember rightly while use this would let me reduce the if count on receive it do offer much help on so i do bother with it the i build be first design build for kbps in but reduce to these kbps do quite well in test kbps speed be pretty much function of filter design the be entirely some of the exist currently deploy on hilltop in test mode while there be not yet end-end flow due to of resource to debug for the mio show in the cnc proceed be perfect copy even though the clock be currently speed the kbytes of the test text of only little over of second i be hop someone would get interest enough to step in get involve in write code to the whole thing ide environment with remote debug possible mention in the proceed but to couple of u be on our own run low on resource of time money energy if in the sf to check it out there be cw id the text on the side from on mtn mtn overlook si the be i guess in retrospect my suggestion this be costly if the intend for user you might to consider your if you your such you complete line-of-sight i think you to the inter-symbol-interference by link budget if very from los for more see the cnc i currently work on spectrum direct conversion design to some of these problem i be to help i with design problem glenn elmore ip glenn internet glenne
