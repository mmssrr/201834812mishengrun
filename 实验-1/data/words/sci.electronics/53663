from schmidt subject ground power wire re question outlet wire there be quite bite of discussion house wire ground here few point need to be the equipment ground conductor green green with yellow stripe or the or pipe of some wire method be use grind to current to the circuit to limit the on the of equipment or other object it should never except for few exception to be discuss the current of connect some equipment filter in the power supply which some slight current flow through the ground conductor much or equipment be sensitive to noise or slight on the ground conductor require wire of the ground conductor to provide outlet often use for this with ground conductor wire to the box in to the service such system should both the section on ground in the electric code on quiet grind system the code require the ground conductor green wire to run with the current conductor to the box if require the to the service where it be bond to the service grind pipe or rod of these system or where they do not provide grind or quiet grind or either the ground conductor of circuit often the which be refer to in the code the identify conductor be suppose to be white or grey this conductor be suppose to be connect to grind in most system single point the service this connection be through the bond jumper in household service the bond jumper be bond screw which the to the of the the ground conductor be current conductor in the of volt circuit it be one of the two conductor complete the circuit from the to the device since the ground conductor be only connect to the ground conductor or green the service if the be from the service current there will be but between the ground ground conductor the under condition if you should incorrectly connect the ground conductor to the ground conductor the some of the current will flow through the ground conductor since there will now be current flow through the ground conductor it will no longer be quite grind the end if the equipment which be connect to the ground conductor through the u grind plug the be now no longer quite grind the difference under non short-circuit condition be only few tenth of volt but it could be volt or two this doe not present shock however if you let the of the ground equipment come into with independently ground object such or pipe condition duct or such of the current will try to flow through this grind if the be not solid you will get low but possibly current under the wrong condition this could fire it be possible in some the grind current could flow through wire of it to with the incorrect non single-point ground of the if there be short circuit from hot to the high short circuit current which flow will much higher on the ground conductor which the possibility for shock or fire if you incorrectly multiply connect the grind the on the grind system be see noise bu computer or equipment often i spend some hour down such short in where they be induce severe hum into equipment the be bond to the grind the distribution well the service of dwell this be do for lightning protection so induce lightning current short to grind to the current by short to ground object like pipe enough current to trip circuit or blow fuse quickly the side of this be not the current from the dwell go through the wire to the some of it flow through the ground electrode pipe etc this corrosion in the pipe possibly in thing like underground fuel oil it field due to the loop between the hot conductor in the service the current in the pipe grind there those who feel these field be do me on this i just tell you where the field come from not it effect i concern the jury be still out on this note the bond jumper be only the not sub distribution this be one why it be to run service with the use to sub you must conductor for the the be use in this only the ground conductor if the be bond to the ground conductor in the sub by forget to remove the bond screw the ground conductor of the on will be grind with the possible problem list the code exception for dryer well fee from one build to in the of the dryer the be use the equipment grind under condition of wire every time the code be revise these exception come up for review these exception be in the first require grind in the before u grind outlet such the do to to redesign their drier the do to to run four wire with four expensive wire in of three wire to the no question it would be with to the stave but the current be low for most burner set since most current be in the volt hots except some low set the wire there few report of injury or so the exception survive in the of fee between build it for lightning protection people do wire should be be be ground conductor obviously the wire in romex grind be there be green wire such in cord be good ground conductor the of bx in bx connector in box be ground conductor in the u bx run under the steel to lower the of the you just cut this off the end you do to bond it to it doe it job by touch every turn of the bx conduit or emt tube be ground conductor but require bond locknut where it enter box or for pipe greenfield look like big bx but you pull your own wire in the empty you run it be not ground conductor it doe the to bond it the steel too much you to run green ground conductor inside the greenfield wiremold be not ground conductor the on the box often prevent good the fee to the wiremold extension be often from box in the not be well connect to the first wiremold box i discover where the entire run of wiremold the of everything plug into the outlet on the run be hot with volt why do i get shock every time i touch my computer the here in the office there no grind wire in the wiremold one of the outlet short to the edge of the wiremold box you must run grind wire in the wiremold from the outlet to the first box in the wire conduit bx etc where you bond the wire to the box with screw bnding clip or on issue while you should grind the green on gcfi outlet when ever there be to grind them it be in the nec to use them without grind if no grind be it be better to the protection of the grind interrupter no protection if you do it the interrupter doe depend on the grind to trip it be to connect the grind if if the grind be connect the interrupter will trip soon device be plug in without the grind it will not trip until someone or something provide grind for those question the use of ungrounded gcfi in the nec d exception this be the code my code be in the city but i know the rule it might be renumbered though we only touch the concern ground there be much more to this subject but most of you by now john john h schmidt internet schmidt director phone university even city new york
