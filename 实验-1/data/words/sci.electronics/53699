from chris reisel subject re do site cool tower do in john write during the fission the fuel get hot enough to melt when this the liquid be pump to the cool tower where it be into the with the cool outside will condense the mist it will to the cool tower floor there it be collect by crew use shop be then reform into pellet for use the next cool tower lot they need to be power force to them by some require the emisions to be hold to under this be now under by the should be the edge of the property the edge of the cool tower this will power of in concrete cost for new nuke john hp-vcd johne i think you post your too be over i do like but i think it not to tell such story them ok let me try to tower be use to even the modernst be only simple it hightech boiler but the rest be still verry verry if you visit see the cool tower too if you look good book thermophysics you find the which describe how to get energy from difference be the for cool tower too you only get energy if you you on the one side need to cool down the you get on the other side if you to get of the energy you or better the bring into the to let it boil if you only hot on the one cold on the other side you loose much more of the energy so they cool down the to get the of energy will give them the cool tower for cool the the you see be not the of the core be the be divide in circuit connect to prevent pollution of the environment ok the core be hot but even in the modernst htr they only run deg celsius this be still verry from melt point which be somewhere deg celsius but you lot of problem with the boiler steel this the be by will corrode verry this be only for bwr the new he cool up to deg celsius but this be only i think should be low ever possible the dose you get will the mrem next mrem wo be mrem it even in you still mrem i not interest in glow in the night get child with this be my point of view only my reisel student of electronic science reisel buebingen voice pgp pubkey begin p h fe ox mmo k vh u m w t q end
