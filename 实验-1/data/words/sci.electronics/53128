from et eric h subject hole question question in jim write i i come this from physic where one often discus the effect of hole it be subtle question the longer one work with them the more they become there which the sort of question how the entity be the phenomenon be most one ok i this before with new on these line i this if hole current be run thru resistor will there be r cool of design hole current over electron current semiconductor the highest of hole mobility to electron mobility quote test on theory do be limit to semiconductor consider resistor dielectric conductor etc note to this so the only where hole not be the be hole only exist in the presence of previous hole only exist in semi-conductors the question be if the hole current inside semi-conductor the point where the semiconductor be join to conductor copper i do discussion here whether hole could exist inside conductor i for discussion on how to detect such current if they exist note i cross-posted this to since this be now become electronic discussion eric et force of
