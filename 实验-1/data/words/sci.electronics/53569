from jeh subject wire question outlet wire since wire question do turn up from time to time on the even to those skilled in electronics i the follow post copy here i the writer to cross-post to in the future jeh x-news cmkrnl newsgroups subject wire ecicrl from clewis chris lewis gmt reply-to wire reception followup-to poster expire gmt inc series of question house wire supersede ecicrl line sun feb est frequently question on wire steven bellovin smb chris lewis clewis comment to if you reply to this this be digest most news skip from one question to the next by press g to other topic to house be from the send empty piece of to for to previous issue with in leave column for new in the question list for new or note this be now register cross-posted to should in the list of list subject question in this be the nec where i get copy be the cec where i get copy i do my own wire pointer do i need in the of tool be ul list be there to book on wire inspection how why should i get my wire inspect my house doe meet some of these rule word on doe service look like be circuit ground versus ground versus doe fuse or do the difference i use fuse wire should i use where do these number come from doe be wirenut connector how they use be where should gfcis be use where should i use gfci be the difference between gfci outlet gfci the purpose of the grind prong on outlet then why be one prong wider the other kind of outlet do i need in kitchen where must outlet switch be in be be bx when should i use should i use or box junction box position i fixture doe it when the light brighten when motor be power should i use it i get it in my house be it better to run motor or be this nonsense on circuit how do i convert two prong to three prong you sure gfcis ungrounded outlet should the test button work how should i wire my shop underground wire wire i buy house should i do be this weird stuff old style wire where do i buy stuff subject we do bite of wire we not we not be responsible for you do if you be correct or do do it someone license or your inspector electricity be no joke result in shock fire or electrocution furthermore our discussion be on the code nec the code cec to the best of our we confirm every with the code but we do quote section simply to keep this thing if you think we wrong we invite you to correct u but quote reference the nec the cec do not in of themselves the force of it en toto others however do not check your with your build hydro inspection office in to find out in your your utility requirement for service in mind too we here to residence dwell mobile home etc sometimes govern by different rule note to belief in the in some of be not wholly-owned of the consequently the nec doe not in lot of thing the include line frequency the of physic but there number of difference in the where we we note them the with nec or cec remember the cec nec it be often to go beyond their requirement subject be the nec where i get copy the nec be model code devise publish by the fire protection industry group it revise every three the version be you buy copy decent bookstore or by them directly the code exist in version there the full text which be incomprehensible there edition which only the section likely to to most house there the nec which the on the code well the full text the recommend version there no for the edition the full be expensive u plus ship subject be the cec where i get copy the be up of government power utility other the publish which be every two or three province with some this publish province-specific code book since province publish it own slightly modify it would be confuse to the itself in this cec the in this be derive from the hydro code edition which be in turn on edition while difference exist between the province be to the code be from inspection office of your power in it hydro the hydro book be overly it c include i these to the nec do bother in quebec diy wire be throughout the province subject i do my own wire pointer in most homeowner to do their own wire in some they not check with your inspector most wo permit you to do wire on other home for money without license nor you permit to do wire in build multiple dwell eg duplex consider or however jurisdiction will permit you to work on wire if you supervise by license if you find one will to supervise if you do your own wire point do it well you to for be better job will do it your own home it you or your might get kill if you time pressure the skill know the trick of the to do job in this we consciously give few in excess of code we feel it will impress the inspector the inspector will know you you to his trust the best of do this be to spend your time do job possible do cut corner exceed otherwise the inspector get extremely picky you on the slightest do try to hide from the inspector use the proper tool ie do use knife to strip wire or twist wire with your finger the inspector wo like it the result wo be it longer you more likely to stick hunk of wire through your do house wire when it very cold eg below or house wire older type become very brittle subject do i need in the of tool first there the obvious drill few screwdriver both if you lucky enough to live in or find source of device you need robertson recess screwdriver of phillips for drill few hole or bite or electric drill will do if you do lot or work with elderly lumber we recommend drill drill wonderful be rent or screw-point drill bite these bite pull you through so they much le even in old timber screw-driver bite useful for drill if you your box use screw screw work well for strip wire use wire stripper not knife or wire cutter do buy the combo stripper crimper bottle opener type you should expect to to for good plier-type it will strip hole wo nick or the wire it should be to strip wire with it one model hole in the for form wire loop for screw there type but they pro do use them of side cutter plier useful for clip end in constrict do use these for strip wire you will need plier for twist wire for wire nut you should of needle-nose plier for fiddle inside box close loop but it better to form wire loop with loop former hole on your wire stripper more if you use get stripper for remove the or do some pro do they nick the end of the the grind wire with of plier simply rip the use the grind wire cut the off you should try to strip the with knife point it too to the on the conductor utility knife fit with linoleum cutter hook be use to strip but there be still the possibility you gouge the conductor for of work with it well worth your while to invest in splitter u tricky to use without cut into the wire or the three-prong outlet tester quick check for properly-wired outlet multimeters tell you more but lot more expensive not worth it for most people simple sensor which detect through wire not supply device be extremely helpful they cost u you should detector to check the wire before do work on them neon-bulb version work well if you get more serious type be good for circuit without helper though i be know to lock the drill on hit until the stop for run wire through exist you need fish often two need though sometimes bend or length of thin will suffice fish be rent lot of it seriously good competent wire job will need very little the be useful for dicy in work use be to the body of outlet switch to cover the screw i do do this but prefer it to prevent explosion when the knife collide with live outlet no cover subject be ul list the ul for underwriter it use to be industry but now it be independent non-profit it test component equipment for when something be ul-listed the ul test the device it meet their requirement for ie fire or shock it doe the device doe it suppose to just it wo kill you the ul doe not power of in the you permit to buy non-ul-listed device however policy sometimes in them will limit their in of in response to the of non-ul-listed device furthermore in the nec will require wire component use for specific purpose be ul-listed for purpose indirectly this of your wire must be ul-listed before inspector will it permit issue subject be every device or component must be certify by the before it be sell in implicit in this be wire must be do with they perform test to the ul bite more stringent except be require by like the ul if fire by equipment your not to the in there be of the ul ulc ul of ulc doe not power of seem to be more group between the subject there to book on wire the follow three book be suggest by our wire by jeff book for isbn wire on the code herbert p richter w creighton book co wire simplify h p richter w c publish co try to sure the book be on the nec revision which be currently knight publish book code simplify there to be version publish specific to province be very tie into the code it focus on wire be indispensible for it be better to get this book the cec unless you do lot of wire or question on the net it be time the code this book be diy store for le c subject inspection how why should i get my wire inspect most jurisdiction require you permit inspection of wire be do other more like not like to to permit inspection provide some you your your neighbor or subsequent owner of your home do get kill or lose their home one night due to sloppy wire job most jurisdiction the power to order you to your home or order you to out wire do without permit for be this if fire in your home un-inspected wire be will often refuse to the in the process go like this you to your inspection office or build for permit you should sketch or of you on do this be good time to question on thing you not sure of if you do work they impose condition on you require other question this point they will tell you which inspection you will need if you you will need to the service connection inspect before your power utility will provide connection this be sometimes do by the power the inspector the box wire but before the go up you will need rough-in inspection the up the wire be complete you will need inspection subject my house doe meet some of these rule do i to in there be no requirement to older dwell though there some exception ie smoke detector in some however new work must be do to the code if you do work you be require to exist portion or of your system check with your inspector subject word on one thing where thing might get bite confuse be the different number people for the of circuit one person might or these in the thing in north the utility require to supply volt fee to your house this work out two leg since there resistive drop in the house wire it not to find drop to or drop to by the time the power outlet the end of extension cord or long circuit run for number of some some simple orneryness different people choose them by slightly different number this choose to be consistent with them except when the will be confuse bite just ignore it one thing might this little more be the on equipment ofen show the lower ie of this imply be the device be design to properly when the drop low be not the be the between of y circuit be from to hot be the between of y circuit from hot to in keep with versus motor intend to run on three often subject doe service look like there four wire involve with supply the with power three of them will come from the utility pole fourth wire come from elsewhere the wire be connect to one or more long pound into the grind or to wire bury in the or sometimes to the supply pipe to be continuous to where the pipe enter the house out for conductivity often between copper iron pipe this be the ground conductor it be there to sure the third prong on your outlet be connect to grind this wire no current one of the other wire will be white or with white or yellow stripe or sometimes simply it be the wire it be connect to the centre cec center in the nec of the distribution supply the power it be connect to the ground conductor in only one often inside the the grind should not be connect else otherwise weird thing furthermore there should only be one ground system in home some code require more one ground electrode these will be connect together or connect to the common point still one ground system ground electrode connect to other portion of the house wire be to code if you the grind bring conductor from the not connect together in the ie still only one connection however in some of build you do to provide second ground electrode consult your inspector the other two wire will be the hot wire they to the distribution well the two wire degree out of with other this if you connect something to both hot wire the will be volt if you connect something to the white either of the two you will get some seem to only three wire come into them this be either the grind connect together different point eg the meter or pole one wire be do both grind or in some the service only one hot wire only service subject be circuit inside the connection to the incoming wire these connection then use to supply power to select portion of the home there three different one hot one grind circuit two hots no grind circuit two hots grind circuit two circuit with common be use for most circuit supply light within your house be use for supply power to such stave dryer they often need for both or for bring circuit from the box to distribution point be for motor circuit electric or conditioner note in the u the nec frequently permit circuit to be use for stave dryer there two hot wire wire doe duty grind be connect to the well provide the for purpose three prong plug of four only for connect to the when connect to most prong plug require in our not-so-humble opinion this be but the this for the nec find to be check your code or inquire to there restriction on when this be permissible be wire with three conductor wire for hot white for for ground one hot wire colour red the other wire for ground in white wire for you will sometimes see wire with just white grind wire since the white be hot in this both the nec cec require the white wire be the end to it be live wire do with polish or sometimes circuit be to the wire come into the through circuit or fuse there in few circuit look like or except they two grind wire some require this for hot tub the like one grind be grind the other to the motor this or not be to gfci protection subject ground versus ground versus to the terminology in the cec nec the ground conductor be for the grind the green or wire the word be reserve for the white when you circuit with more one hot wire since the white wire be connect to the ground conductor inside the the proper term be ground conductor however the confusion between ground conductor ground conductor to you should never use the wire ground conductor or white wire the ground conductor even though they connect together in the but not in feed grind from the in the in common the word be use for ground conductor this us simply to confusion we recommend you use too thus the white wire be except in some light switch not grind subject doe fuse or do the difference fuse circuit design to interrupt the power to circuit when the current flow exceed level for if your short out fuse or should trip protect the wire in the from melt such fuse intend to protect the wire ul or supposedly the equipment itself wo fire fuse strip of which be design to melt when the current exceed the thereby interrupt the power to the circuit fuse trip which sometimes be problem with motor which current surge for motor circuit you use fuse one be fusetron which will trip on fusetron look like fuse fuse only trip once then it must be device they consist of one spring which be into position when the current flow through the device exceed the strip up bend by bend it trip the the spring pull the circuit to fusetrons be they tend to longer to trip fuse with high they trip quickly be reset finite number of time time they trip or throw when the circuit be in use some which the thus should not be use in of switch unless they list for the purpose neither fuse nor limit the current per se short on circuit hundred or sometimes even of to flow for short period of time which often severe subject i use fuse show fuse higher risk of fire this be due to the fuse be loosely screw in or the corrode up over time or the wrong fuse be or the the fuse with penny trick since more better connection the risk of fire be le fuse prone to explode under extremely high when fuse explode the cloud become conduct result from complete meltdown of the melt service wire through fire in the distribution your house burn down do do this jurisdiction in no longer permit fuse in new the nec doe permit new fuse in some require the insert to key the fuseholder to specific fuse some device conditioner require fuse protection in to the the the fuse be there to protect the motor wind from check the on the unit this be only on motor the instruction will tell you if you need one subject wire should i use for circuit use wire for circuit you use wire in most for long run though you should use the next wire to drop be only slightly more expensive though it stiffer to work with here quick for go up for more foot run when the be in conduit or with other wire in where they we do list bigger it get very dependent on the precise wire type subject where do these number come from there two drop buildup the the wire be the higher the be when the be higher the wire up more there be more drop in the wire the former be why you need bigger wire for use in conduit the be why you should use wire for long run neither effect be very over very short there some very specific exception where use of wire be the obvious one be the line cord on most do try this unless you your use fit one of those exception you never go wrong by use wire subject doe this be use to describe the of conductor in the first number specify the the second the number of current conductor in the wire but remember there grind wire two current wire plus grind wire white grind wire sometimes the white be red for circuit without in the the be red too wire red white grind wire with subject be wirenut connector how they use wire nut be cone thingummy use to connect wire together or connector you use lot of them in diy wire in essence you strip the end of the wire inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenuts you do need to twist the wire do it it more secure there different of wire nut you should check the wire nut you use be the correct for the of wire you connect together do just gimble the wire together with of plier or your finger use of blunt nose plier twist the wire tightly sometimes it good to trim the result end to sure it go in the wirenut properly some people the open end of the wirenut with this be not good the inspector it off during inspection it do bite of wire be expose outside the wire nut of it the connection should be redo subject be gfci be circuit interrupter it the current current flow through the hot wire the wire if they differ by more few the presumption be current be to grind some other this be of short circuit to the of or to the grind or through person of these be so the gfci trip the circuit gfcis do not protect kind of electric shock if for you touch the hot of circuit no of you ground gfci would help of the current from the hot into you would return the keep the gfci the two of connection on gfci outlet not symmetric one be the other line the incoming power fee must be connect to the line side or the outlet will not be protect the side be use to protect device from it thus whole string of outlet be cover by single gfci outlet subject where should gfcis be use the nec gfcis for or single outlet in kitchen within of the sink unfinished or outdoors pool or just else where you likely to encounter or there exception for outlet those to occupy fix for sump pump the cec doe not gfcis in there be no requirement to protect kitchen outlet or most or outlet outlet must be protect if you dirt floor outlet if they the door to outside most exterior outlet must gfcis even if you not require to gfci protection you to consider it unless you need gfci see below the cost be low in the gfci outlet cost little u cost bite higher in c your own risk doe your finish ever get wet do you child do you use your outlet to power outdoor tool doe or melt snow ever puddle inside your subject where should i use gfci gfcis not use on circuit do pose risk b use to power equipment must run for long period of time sump pump good the be gfcis sometimes prone to trip some people the inductive in motor wind current trip the gfci note though most gfci trip if you get lot of trip for no you be to check your wire before decide the gfci be break or useless subject be the difference between gfci outlet gfci for most you use either gfci outlet the first device on the circuit or you with built-in gfci the former be prefer since gfci quite expensive for ge cost u the gfci model cost u there be one exception if you need to protect multi-wire circuit two or more circuit common wire such kitchen circuit you need multi-pole gfci these expensive the cost into the hundred of depend on of box you but if you must protect such circuit for pool you no choice one more gfci outlet bulky you to use box when them on second think use deep box everywhere you yourself for it if you gfci to ensure one specific outlet be protect such you do to go to of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the not gfci of it but protect the whole circuit be prefer when you gfci it good to use the little grind protect sticker come with it the outlet of the gfci you figure out which outlet simply by trip the gfci with the test button see which outlet subject the purpose of the grind prong on outlet then from their use in electronics which we wo comment on for fluorescent light they wo turn on without good grind connection they intend to within the device the of the be connect to the grind if there short the hot to the the grind conduct the electricity possibly trip the circuit in the process if the be not ground such short occur the be live if you touch it while you ground you get of course if the circuit be gfci-protected it will be very tiny which be why you use gfcis to ungrounded outlet both nec cec there some should never be ground in to else with expose conductor consider if you touch the electrode in you not ground nothing will if you slightly ground you get shock the will be too high but if the be ground you be hold it you be the perfect to grind subject why be one prong wider the other two-prong device one prong wider the other this be so the device could rely not on one specific wire be the other hot this be in light fixture where the the shell should or other device which to grind reference ie some most extension cord wide prong too this require you wire your outlet plug the right you the wide prong to be the one hot most outlet for the hot screw lighter colour screw for the if not you figure out which be which by which prong the screw connect to subject kind of outlet do i need in kitchen the nec require two circuit for kitchen the cec require split-duplex outlet must be such no point be more nec mm cec from outlet every counter wider nec or mm cec must one outlet the circuit these outlet on not fee outlet except in the kitchen or din room furthermore these circuit in to require for stave light etc outlet within of sink must be protect by gfci nec only split duplex feed with circuit the be break on the hot side of the outlet one hot go to the upper outlet the other hot go to the lower outlet the connect to both outlet through one screw when through to outlet the must be such remove the outlet or the connection off doe the to disconnect from outlet subject where must outlet switch be in there must be one outlet in to the sink in to outlet be in the light fixture such outlet must be gfci-protected subject be be bx when should i use romex be for type of wire sometimes the be nm this be for use in dry protect ie inside stud on the side of joist etc not subject to or excessive most newer home wire exclusively with nm wire there different of nm bx know or flexible or steel over the conductor be to teck be with protection for in where nm or be run through stud joist or wooden member the outer of the must be keep cec nec from the edge of the wooden member or the should be protect from injury this protection the form of such outlet box end or conduit note inspector-permitted in suggest or flexible conduit be use the protection but this be protection these rule in the code they to the reference to expose to in both the nec cec nm should be protect where it through floor or on the of in expose under foot from the floor ie use flexible conduit wooden etc where be suspend in connection to or the wire should be protect be to junction or outlet box on the use short length of or nm in flexible conduit to jump to the nm to piece of lumber be sometimes use where nm be run in close proximity to duct or pipe should be by of or of nm be support within of every box or fit of no more hole in joist or stud consider support some in the should be provide to box while fish be in it be permit where proper support be conductor nm should never be on edge knight insist on only one per refer to the but this seem more honour in the should never be bury in cement or finish should be protect where it run behind not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joist or the lower edge of where the be more whenever bx be box with bush must be insert in the end of the to prevent the force the end of the through the bx be sometimes good in work shop unless cover by solid cover in where be more likely like on the of you be require to use conduit ul or pipe you use type of fit to join the pipe or provide for the wire service frequently use conduit in eg bury wire to outdoor light you will need wire eg cec nec uf look like very you will need short length of conduit where the wire the grind see underground wire section wire such nm nmw etc should not be expose to direct sunlight unless explicitly for purpose code do not permit the rout of wire through duct include cold return plenum construct by sheet enclose joist the for this be if there fire the ducting will toxic from burn very through the build teflon wire be permit in plenum in to use wire to the u except wire include the in celsius eg versus in the u nm-b be degree celcius note code this be one of the item most often eg code require conduit everywhere there very different requirement for mobile home check your code if you do the slightest out of the wire selection incomplete the enormous uncommon wire type or omit condition type cec nec dry nm nmc wet expose to nmwu tw etc direct nmwu uf service rwu twu nmwu not for service subject should i use or box the nec permit use of box with only the be simple with the box itself provide grind conductor continuity box do use the cec be slightly different the cec never permit ground conductor however you must still provide grind continuity for the cec require ground of on box the of box be minor even for you one grind connection they sometimes cost little le on the other box more to for expose or shop wire box better subject junction box position junction box be box use only for connect wire together junction box must be in such they ie not bury under excessive use of junction box be often sign of sloppy inspector get subject i light fixture in one fixture freely subject to few first of course one should check the of the circuit if your be set on floodlight you need to run new wire to the box but there some more subtle well for older house wire doe the excess by ceiling-mounted will the to with obvious result some newer fixture for high wire only you find in your ceiling wire this problem in which device be other concern include provide grind for some fluorescent fixture sure the ceiling box it mount strong enough to support the weight of or ceiling you need to new box list for this purpose the ceiling joist good support be fish into ceiling thru the junction box hole mount between the joist there rule for recess light fixture such pot or when these in ceiling they present very fire the cec provide for the of pot in ceiling provide the fixture be box in coffin by of joist high cover with plywood doe yes foot long nec rule le stringent they require between the fixture sort of the rule one should not obstruct free movement which cec-style coffin might be worthwhile up to the inspector the cec doe the coffin per-se this seem to be inspector requirement to the fixture get bury in ie if you blow in there now fixture cutout be bury directly in they limit to bulb more expensive the older type before you use them you should ensure they explicit ul or for such us follow the instruction the prescribe for the sensor there doe not yet to be fixture be for use in the coffin the only subject doe it when the light brighten when motor this the wire in the be loose depend on the one hot wire end up be more the other le with respect to grind this be very it destroy your electronic equipment possibly fire in some electrocute you ie some u jurisdiction require the stave connect to if this your them come check out the problem note brief second brighten be sometimes with light motor on the with circuit loose will show brightness longer one second in of doubt get help subject be power should i use it i get it in my house three power three hot wire degree out of with other these use for motor it be more efficient provide bite more torque the motor simpler hence you most likely to encounter circuit show volt between hot grind volt between two hots the show the difference between common circuit which be volt between the two hots there circuit with different bring in fee to your house be ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you to run motor mount it be much to buy new or motor for it in some it be possible to run equipment on power if you unit or use motor these tricky but good solution if the motor be or too expensive or too big to the press book the shop on how to do this if you must note you lose possible efficiency by use such converter the of subject be it better to run motor or it doe difference however there be difference be the of power lose in the supply wire thing be motor will lose time le power in the house wire motor this the surge loss will be le the motor will get to speed quicker in some the power loss will to longer motor life this be unless the supply wire more foot long subject be this nonsense on circuit it be hp be to give loss power other inefficiency it be best to consider hp be go to need circuit only deliver to motor so it not possibly be more hp give efficiency be more like it some equipment in most router in hp be in excess of be possible they give you horsepower or the power be when the motor be just to stop turn of the they do mention be if you keep it in condition for more few second hopefully your will trip otherwise the motor will melt it more current it continuously when motor the continuous horsepower this should be on the motor if you find figure check the which be present subject how do i convert two prong to three prong older home frequently two-prong of the more modern three these no grind the no grind wire neither the nec or cec permit new prong there different to solve this if the wire be do through conduit or bx the conduit be continuous to the you connect the third prong of new to the box nec cec frown on this if there be copper cold pipe go it continuous to the house grind point you run conductor to it from the third prong run grind conductor to the gfci the grind lug should not be connect to but the gfci protection itself will serve the gfci will protect possibly two prong outlet if you do this to protect outlet the grind must not be connect together since it would be connect to grind wire could the of prong device connect to other outlet be sure though there indirect grind plug connection such the on bx the cec permit you to two prong with three prong if you fill the u grind with non-conducting goop like compound this be not permit in the nec subject you sure gfcis ungrounded outlet should the test button work we sure the nec cec remember though your code for the test button there resistor connect the side of the hot wire to the line side of the wire when you press the test button current through this resistor show up trip the gfci this be simple test doe require grind to work if your gfci doe not trip when you press the test button it be very defective or miswired if the test button doe work something break the problem should be correct the instruction come with some gfcis specify the grind wire must be connect we do not know why they this the be old instruction sheet or with the of ul or list the device never test without the grind wire be connect on the other ul or should only be if the device properly in list include ungrounded outlet one of u leviton their gfcis for on ground circuit only the surprise to see he the nec doe not require it promise to subject how should i wire my shop with other kind of wire you need enough power for device will be on the code specify you should under of the of the circuit for home shop use this one circuit for the power tool possibly one for dust collector or shop use wire power tool big motor with big surge if you use nec though cec require which you to replug your equipment light should either be on circuit of their own not with circuit in the rest of the house or be on two circuit the be you to where be still spin rpm while you grope in the for the off switch do lot of outlet it to them in the begin when you do to cut into exist it useful if two circuit point so you run shop or compressor the time the tool you but use box even you object fly high speed if something go bite wrong note some jurisdiction no wire rule in workshop or other unfinished use for work this be wire must be run member ie to stud other possible shop circuit include circuit circuit for some tool compressor circuit do circuit do use extension cord if you help it unless they for high current coil extension cord be not length of wire of the the wo much be the issue if your shop be some remove from your you should derive your shop wire from it if you young child you to equip this with cut-off switch possibly lock if you to switch to circuit sure you get one high enough for light switch not to the surge by buy switch note most home shop in or unfinished hence the nec requirement for gfcis even if you know you never use one of your shop outlet to run mower the next owner of your house might different note fine woodworking often on shop wire be one to subject underground wire you will need to trench to use wire protect the wire with conduit or tube possibly lumber do use creosote lumber it rot in the corrosion of the from in-house to underground wire be conduit outdoor box must be list for the purpose the fit etc if the of the box be subject to immersion in more serious style of box be need of course do forget the gfcis the require depth other from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector your specific hint buy roll of bright yellow bury power line bury it few inch where the wire be subject wire during the of copper wire quite extensively use since time wire be in number of house fire most jurisdiction no longer permit it in new we recommend even if you to do not use it for new wire but do if your house wire wire when properly be just copper wire be however very unforgiving of improper we will cover bite of the theory behind problem you do to your wire the problem with wire be phenomenon know cold creep when wire up it when it cool down it unlike copper when go through number of cycle it lose bite of tightness time to the problem worse oxidise or corrode when in with type of so the of the connection go up which it to up corrode still more the wire get very hot melt the or fixture it to possibly even fire since people encounter wire when they move into house build during the we will cover point of wire we suggest if you consider home with wire or discover it you hire license or inspector to check over the wire for the follow thing fixture eg outlet switch directly to wire should be for it the device will be with or the supersede the former but both these fixture more expensive the one wire should be properly connect the screw in clockwise direction connection should be tight while tighten of the screw the problem worse during the inspection it would off to snug up connection note wire be still often use for the service it should be inspect push-in extreme with wire connection use push-in should be redo with the proper screw connection there should be no sign of connection melt or fixture such should be connection between copper wire need to be current code require the wire nut use must be for connect to copper the nec require the wire be connect together use crimp device with the tool for the quite expensive not to do it yourself unless you rent the tool be connect to wire by of short copper see show wire properly strip not nick wire etc if when consider home inspection of the wire show no problem or only one or two we believe you consider the wire if there sign of problem in we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong use you them with the proper type or use this do from to per you do this yourself too subject i buy house should i do but it good to hire inspector to look through the house for hide not just for wire but plumb well if inspection of the wire show no problem or only one or two minor one we believe you consider the wire minor problem fix if there sign of problem in we suggest you look elsewhere here some hint on to look for obvious non-code wire include cord wire either or to hot wire on the identify conductor without proper ungrounded ground outlet except when of gfci splice in other proper switch unsecured romex swing like wire to code or be one time sometimes diy wire hide switch seem to control nothing not properly wire switch shut off group of light control by other switch except when it convenient switch outlet in number of junction box without outlet or junction box with number of wire go into them wire through closet of or ceiling ground wire subject be this weird stuff old style wire in the since edison invent electricity different wire style come go when you buy older home you encounter some of this stuff this section describe the old method some of their the oldest wire system you likely to encounter be knob tube k t it be up of conductor with cloth the wire run side member eg joist or stud use knob wire be run through member use tube connection be by twist the wire together solder with since the hot be run the wire tend to be confuse often run down the centre of room with off to fixture the hot wire tend to run from one fixture to the next in some k t be colour-coded so the be often the colour the hot wire you see k t in home build the comment on k t the people k t be pretty electricity so the tend to be pretty good the wire tend to up very well most k t i see for be in quite good condition no ground ground be difficult to box with gfci be difficult no bush on box either so wire need to box entry sometimes the be very well between hot circuit so it be sometimes possible to the without exceed the fuse on circuit build code doe not permit in k t connection to exist k t from new circuit be tricky consult your inspector modern wire require more outlet to be k t system do since k t tend to be in pretty decent condition it be to it simply it k t you should out for be interfere with it be circuit in it perfectly to exist k t new fixture on new circuit use modern technique k t they invent multi-conductor the first type you will see be roughly cloth it look much like the romex of the or two this stuff use in the no ground conductor it much like modern wire it be this type of embrittle we see whole system where the would off touch bx of the problem this stuff be very become if the wire become this wire should be leave untouched much possible whenever opportunity it simple or switch turn into hour long fight with or tube this wire technique the more modern romex invent it cloth often bite sticky this stuff up well doe present be to work with it doe not need to be it should be consider the modern stuff wire just do it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find proper supply outlet you their price will often be better store or diy centre better wider include the odd stuff people behind the counter know you friendly
