from lung subject re telephone on hok ok circuit in john thomson write just think of mine here since on-hook line be off-hook it drop below how lead in series with on-hook lead on off-hook lead off would this work if it let me know there the rub if you enough current to light lead the equipment the phone will think you go off hook in the on-hook you not suppose to current which you should just use your voltmeter you use old vom but the phone equipment detect might think there something wrong with the look guy the problem here if you light go on when the be off hook you need it to run it in series with the line i mention in my previous post if you light go on when the be on hook you need be threshold detector if you go to do the series diode thing which be the just sure the lead the current i it but it something like or more now folk consider the be force on ring tip when the phone suppose to ring even with simple lead setup you might end up with some quick scheme you use sure you get component on the frontend remember if i not the phone line be circuit current you from the or so get drop fine until you down to roughly when bell consider it to be off-hook but drop it down be big no-no the to the tip rectifier resistor diode v resistor v lead ring this be only suggestion go blow hole in it but you get the choose high-efficiency lead so you do need much current to get it to light up choose for the other component require
