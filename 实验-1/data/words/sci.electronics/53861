from whit john whitmore subject re circuit in write suppose we function which be sum-of-products derive from or something like this f b c d bc the book on logic design i consult seem to imply this be where the end but by out the term in the function we get fewer f b c d bc cd bc which yield yes but the of be in of time ttl the structure of inversion of sum of product be just one the to find sum of product be this positive-or such the solution us two there in the second term so the second solution while simpler in logic symbol be expect to be something le in the world ecl be to ttl in it support with the minimum unlike ttl you get both true inverse output for when use ecl with your choice of connection between the section some so minimum sum of product be to shoehorn logic design into few it not to design with of logic but some to you to do so will just mess of nodelist with series logic ic produce description of logic cell to do the job xilinx doe this by logic block it out then simplify john whitmore
