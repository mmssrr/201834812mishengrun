from lee subject re science methodology in turpin russell turpin write i with everything lee write in her previous post in this gee i misjudge you russell who with something i be seriously i not sure whether i misjudge you or not in one respect i still problem though with your insistence science be i still with your contention nobody who doe use method deem scientific possibly know true not delete which i with to lee these not the rule to who post to to these poster if it not support by design control study then it not science these poster the i previously of to recipe rule such support the hypothesis by design control study too to to i think the requirement for to be convince depend on the kind of occur in the kind of thing to reuse the previous we know conclusion from uncontrolled of the of chronic problem notoriously so let see if we on this first of there degree of it might be for to control before we scientific truth to the extent there be such thing the effectiveness of on the other highly experience even if uncontrolled be to justify judgement be useful this be often the best evidence we hope for from who do not or support in this it sense to credible but to reserve judgement until scientist who the resource do more test secondly it sense to be more in our of evidence for pronounce effect for one be i come to this dispute science be not only but of in in nlp neurolinguistic much of the work do to by nlpers be better scientific for now i be try to get scientific psychologist to just look it to few of the book some of the courtesy of your university not for the purpose of definitive judgement but simply to look the nlp methodology the to elicit from subject look for hypothesis which might be of scientific interest most to be of the question nlp suggest which might be worthy of scientific over over the response i get in be if this be thoroughly by the form of then it be of interest to u to me the reducio of the extreme there get to be control study position be nlp technique the cure simple oppose to not be the world most disorder but the nice thing them be it doe instrument to them or tell when someone be cure of one the nlp cure be simple which require le minute nlpers it be use to memory hence be useful in stress syndrome it be on the process use by subject only need to be through the technique once or in the of ptsd once for incident the process doe need to be the subject doe need to it over home now to me it seem pretty to test the effectiveness of this cure if nlpers the success be extremely high someone with of height i use to them up to on the floor observe their response spend minute to them do the simple send them up to the see if thing check with them in few week to see if the cure seem to be more long term follow-up be but from scientific point of view even cure week in there know where the cure to the best of my knowledge there be no know where the cure be reverse hold for few week my own cure do with slightly different nlp technique before i of the cure ten now i enjoy live on the floor of my build the folk over in hundred one excuse not to this simple test they only outcome study will be study of the sort nlp of whom live from their ill to do most of them just not interest the whole seem frivolous since they not of the scientific they no to from scientific the cure be over ten old now the psychology be still we do of know it effective these themselves the resource to do study could of course but they why should i prove your theory the burden of proof be on the one the one in it would be completely unscientific for him to test the cure since it be describe in scientific it describe in number of book i post in describe it in much i of one study be do with result but it not it not publish in referee to me this sort of doe not science but hinder it this be the kind of thing i in mind when i science now i be in impute such to you russell if so i in the between cognitivists psychology seem le like science collection of compete religious sect
