from ruegg robert g ruegg subject re eugenics subject re eugenics gordon write within new type of eugenics will be possible even sooner we now the genome we will then to work on of genome use genetic engineer we will be to insert gene we no breed no hybrid etc the question be should we two problem with eugenics be reduce the gene pool define the of the insert gene would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the insert gene to progeny then they be to crowd out gene this in the future become possible even if it doe of the need to the gene pool would hopefully provision will be for gene come in evidently the gene for sickle cell in for in the hopi promote in some condition we do know the future hold for our environment the reduce wilderness of our inbred come to mind winter ice meteor new etc etc therefore gene possible be good for specie of course the of would out no different else but if we could philosopher-kings with body long life would we or they to give them we could the do it with their king without the benefit of such eugenics the with the problem which but for while it problem orwell introduce u to the notion of might to person for more but there be nothing new under the sun we the for before i see no inherent problem with gene which these problem trouble the virtue wisdom to use power into their to good end the time stop the whole yet the which die from to to however the which die from the of their own power the one which survive hopefully lesson from the of others survive by better choice when their turn not i do think this gene power could wipe u off the of the or endless suffer power or or could still do too the issue be issue of wisdom virtue i do think enough wisdom virtue to pull this next off better he do the for few we eugenists it we not if we do i hope there reservoir of people out in some with otherwise long gene which will pull u through i believe the problem be will be the need to input from the spirit of god to overcome his in the of know how to use the power he some men i believe men listen to obey the still voice of god in their this be the to begin to recieve the wisdom virtue need to the problem consequent to poor choice people die out for the society which to enough input from god to use the power they develop destroy themselves often others in the process it be self-evident the one which survive either enough input from the spirit to use their power wisely enough to or survive their own thus or else enough power for long enough in i would the question of whether to use this new technology be one the in some in some be the it be the power it be the spirit sorry for the long post get bob ruegg
