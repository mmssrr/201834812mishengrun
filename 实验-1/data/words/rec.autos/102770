from welty welty subject frequently question this be one of of commonly question the other question of consumer interest be break out to crossposting to rpw ct now permit detector new q rpw commonly question question q where detector in the u currently the district of prohibit of detector new york prohibit their use in truck in they in quebec pei prince they through most if not of europe which would them be pending in other jurisdiction of such q where detector detector use do they work be they be use only in but now they in new york it be to they not in use in connecticut they work by detect frequency by currently super het detector some of detector more strongly others thus more likely to be spot new detector become which not be detect by the current of detector detector note detector only be spot by one of these device if it be turn on q be be it some kind of be nothing more computer it depend on the press button the vehicle no emit by system q be where be it use should detector be to it recently be by the fcc for use in the u in in these low-powered be the degree to the direction of picture be of vehicle which the unit determine to be in of the speed limit ticket to the owner of the vehicle of the low power the degree people believe detector not give of unit some of detector such the number of where be in use be limit some question the of such unit best photo unit look like keep of where they use or else do speed q do work they quick no not in the do not work well work expensive the property of the of the of the commission of the drive technique vehicle question q understeer oversteer understeer oversteer term describe the of while corner the limit limit of be most driver do not drive enough for these term to be descriptive of the they encounter simply put they tell whether the to go in corner steer le or understeer or it to turn more in corner oversteer understeer be commonly design into most production so driver too wo get into trouble understeer be induce by use too much throttle in corner oversteer be design into some more orient it be induce by lift on the throttle throttle oversteer or tto in extreme lift on the throttle induce so much oversteer the by or spin some in corner speed the tire on the will develop slip the slip be the difference between the direction the be the direction the steer wheel be direct the to in understeer the front wheel slip the wheel in oversteer the wheel slip the front wheel q be downshift when downshifting the engine must be in the lower it in the higher however during downshift you declutch lift your foot from the throttle so the rev drop in downshift you blip the throttle before the clutch so the engine will be up to the new speed this result in much smoother downshift q doe be technique use to do downshift while this be you need the right foot for both the throttle it be you use one end of the foot on the the other on the throttle to rev for the downshift in modern this be misnomer often you must use the of the foot on the the right side on the throttle note some driver will skip the clutch just use the leave foot on the the right foot on the throttle the thing q be double-clutch downshifting while your right foot be do the your leave foot do one of three thing nothing declutch once or declutch twice the for declutch twice be to the speed of the two in the to the speed of the engine this be couple with so while the engine be in the clutch the throttle be blipped both of the speed up the procedure be follow declutch move lever to clutch rev declutch move lever to next lower clutch this sound like lot of work but with it become the problem double-clutching solve be the function of the within the in without synchro or with very wear synchro double-clutching it much to shift if you double-clutch well you not use the synchro this be on street with synchro in good condition q do the number for from mile time in the they be in short not much the you to believe never in more the number mile time in the u be long they come from the source test procedure so much from to number to driver number be quite pointless keep in mind too the from driver to driver on the street the driver be often the of the even if they do figure only test of the stickiness of the stock tire they when tire compound do not the of two sport on number this be not to suggest without however excellent tool drive school they simply of limit in the of except tire time slightly more useful they test some of the response however they influence by the stock rubber on the they do not test corner of the envelope they do not tell you you need to know before buy decision for they do tell you the end of the will do on which suddenly go when suspension these test do in the sport set which be quite for drive the list of could go on for q my buddy wide tire do difference to his physic textbook you ever or corner more doe he know he in short he get clue in more the for friction use in physic textbook presume the smooth dry none of which properly to tire except in the of stone cold tire on dry which be below it proper be never smooth it be to or lesser extent tire which not dry solid rubber be which in it form be liquid which only be coerce into of solidity by deform to the of the which vehicle be over in tire grip be by stress inside the deform rubber not by even remotely resemble friction in the physic sense of the term the colder tire be to it the closer it will be to the concept of friction if much hotter the it proper the more likely the possibility of some of the tire revert to liquid which be mostly like to deep in the blister chunk this though be completely unlikely to in street drive so unless you competition driver or do lot of high speed drive do worry it tire be completely out of the of simple friction it doe not obey the physic thus more corner more simple friction doe not it be possible for different to differ of grip of tire would require technique such finite element due to the complexity of the misc question q doe or for here be list of some of the which commonly be in solicit the of other on the net in never in if you useful result b or the swedish or the di torino or the of turin bmw motoren werke or motor work mg morris q doe vw own porsche no porsche be publicly hold control by the porsche piech porsche extensive business with which some confusion since currently porsche be in some difficulty there be possibility mercedes or vw be interest in the in the future but this be only this time welty welty nothing good ever be report the full of either it pitch or roll smith
