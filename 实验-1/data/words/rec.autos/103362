from kimgh gene kim subject review ford sho review of ford sho by gene kim week i buy ford sho move up from drive st oldsmobile i be interest in buy sho for five month be comb the in denver every week i buy sho with mile on it for i tell this be under blue book i still mile before the extend service run out one should with shos i sure the refit with the clutch pressure well be for rotor however my sho doe not the newer rod shifter i i get this for from ford service center in the receive the full tune-up mile receive new plug for with mile on it the the job devoid of chip or dent the front cover with lot of not surprise since most of the mile be spend on the drive two-door coupe for so long i bite concern whether i could get use to drive to my surprise the of the doe bother me it seem just nimble my no with my oldsmobile visibility from the driver be excellent help mostly by of the the of the door window in front of the window be bite more difficult but other i love the in i to the trunk i up for drive to dc for the summer more on the ride in this review engine with even slightly interest in shos i very interest in the shogun engine i not of the engine under rpm be good you even do from second i do of this the engine rev smoothly tool town doe not require shift this be good since the shifter be definitely one of the point of the more on this while the of the engine under rpm be it undergo once you hit higher rev rpm butterfly open you feel the geometry of the engine twelve more open up the engine to it rpm redline you to in my opinion the sweetest sound the engine sound overjoy to be rpm i notice when i drive town i the to see how below rpm i to go from rpm to you to punch the while torque be more it doe come fully online until those other use when driver first review the in they how ford put such wimpy clutch shifter into the i remember drive friend sho in remember think whether i the leg strength to drive the in the clutch stiff then the entire clutch on my sho be under ford in the clutch on the sho feel no stiffer the one on my in the friction point seem bite more forgive when with the shifter with the the shifter felt very the be where you expect it to be the shift smooth on the it much the but you to shift slowly no it clumsy shifter when hurry shift like when i try to impress friend i consistently miss the shift often grope clumsily for the shift sometimes even muff the shift i find this pretty in like this it take me to you get the smoothest shift when you your time seem obvious but to my my friend this seem clumsy someone on note crxs should blow shos off-the-line of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more the shifter seem more when you within these bind the shifter work smoothly with no surprise i do know whether the rod shifter would help these line i trouble shift smoothly slow down the shift more to rev when let out the clutch help immensely this take for me to get the of i think some of my problem be i never with enough power to shift in higher i trouble shift into reverse the shifter refuse to enter the i often grind the synchro try to get it into i be this in the next couple of month quirk when i upshift the engine drop to rpm i whir then grind noise come from the the engine not terribly loud but the definitely it i it when i look the do my this be definitely sho sound be the rollover reply to my query on the end of this review exterior i mention before i by how well the body of this sho stand up chip on the front bumper grille non-existent look how older sometimes do so i wonder the guy ford do differently to the sho body the body in my opinion be extremely with color body mold the stock for some odd the sho seem different enough from to get stoplight of course this could be my shos get fog light more open grille completely exterior deeper grind skirt in the with sho stencil in relief i see couple shos whose owner color these in with florescent color or in yuck i do think the be i like it i feel with those out there but different distinctive enough to those of u who interior the interior be me feel like i do deserve the the grey the steer wheel shifter cover with the entire instrument be do in scheme the be stock except for the mph speedo rpm you get center console with two cupholders under the for cd yet three coin holder for i think for hold there in the door oddly glove i spill whole of coke in the cupholder delight to find the entire rubber holder be remove in sink hey i impress with the ergonomics thoughtfulness go into it design it before the interior the be bigger i why do they need so much no comment the driver side bolster from i it not uncommon for the side bolster to show mine be no exception the leave side bolster on the driver i not convince the right bolster be the big surprise for me i forget shos do they the you press with your leave foot too i get use to it but it seem bite to me ride the suspension be nice stiff too stiff it stiffer i friend new st seem be still to up bump better the sho seem stiffer with le to up bump drive over be noisy on the other turn feel wonderful the body be so rigid doe flex i listen for before i buy the on the the ride be when i drive the from to purdue i trouble keep under mph let from try to see mph feel like it quiet ride but the sunroof i try to find out the noise up there but it seem to be the window rest on the no to get rid of it i think over the three i between think the suspension be wonderful perfect think the ride be too rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i would my to buy one for himself but i discover with the shifter if you your time with shift you no to let me the ride be worst when turn lot of power to the wheel i feel the wheel for torque steer the skitter leave right i understand this i the limit of i it not body rigidity but the composure of the if the suspension the steer feel be quite my first impression of drive my sho how you to turn the wheel speed it but when drive lot the high-effort steer do seem so useful however it but it doe the to the driver well ford probe gt imho it much better the steer on my st i wonder how this be during winter note gripe the from the sunroof be intermittent some it loudly other i look up wonder where the noise go the sunroof be sometimes very noisy loud it on it i wonder if there be quick fix for this other it completely function of humidity once i the connection between the sometimes feel suspension torque steer i never ride i wish the more support under the thigh i wish the side bolster would close more tightly i tire for this get expensive i currently cost the previous owner for four i use to the ford stereo system whose it to use volume now to my i do mind sometimes think it pretty ridiculous though get up to rpm sometimes seem to be chore but this be no big there be more enough torque down low i often goof up the shift when drive with friend it take me couple of before i could shift smoothly from to to believe be it my mile on it my note it be impossible to find sho imho i wonder how long i my sho i just buy book title drive it forever for tip in this the goofy still throw me for loop i once the in then let out the clutch i it the jolt bounce off the in front of me no but the be whole new for me with i to wonder how strong be i out of spot to drive before i notice the glow light oops the driver power window when close the the thing in my mercury oddly the other window work smoothly like i like the interior more more the cupholders i do expect to use the keyless entry button so much but it be you lock the door by press the button together you never lock yourself out of the i feel like i do deserve this i believe i could it i get this ten of schedule i love this so much i be tell my to look into buy one i love this so much i write this file i to write couple of line end up with this if there be power survey for use owner i would opportunity to express my incredible of own this i do like think get but this point in time i sure i buy sho for under you it next time with though this be big win i the premium on my despite it twice the horsepower other odds end much to my there be no sho list the sho registry fill this void i join yet but i notice query shos still on once month owner of shos quick to respond very of the some of the most on i put together the response to my question the well other post with useful on these i be post this in the form of soon if be interest in list up i do know if i the resource here purdue to one but someone out there
