from ted fischer subject old prediction to oops i this file from think you might enjoy some of these think the prediction be on the they out of order june me i do i compute the expect win for from their obp run i use the rc the projection i then this with their win through june obp tb w l xwp diff boston toronto new york detroit city you know how thing turn out the oriole red sox the tiger continue the expect the brewer in the second the take dive should surprise predict the drop behind the they do deserve the record in june the white sox up their bite while the twin drop off little but for the most thing be expect so there be few error but for predictive i think this do pretty well from tue the insert kent mercker into the sometime this bielecki be or lei become the fifth the best bullpen in berenguer wohlers pete smith who well hm pete smith the of mercker bielecki until the end of the i wo comment on the bullpen jeff win the shortstop job outright by the end of go on the dl klesko go on nice hit honeymoon gregg jefferies in with hunter mitchell win the center field job bite nixon on pinch-runner lonnie be unless the find in right on wrong on mitchell bite on lonnie with bielecki do pick do to be fire this in order fregosi riddoch three of them go right be still likely to stick it seem from tue bond get from bucs for some young nope they win the division so keep him for shoot the mets win division well they do finish in the west get one right surprise everyone but finish second behind toronto nope dwight gooden win but be by who win i guess this be why you pick the mets to win huh roger clemens be injure in the tsk tsk not nice to predict something like this to hit even home run be often injure due to dodger drop out of you get right my response from tue hmph tell you mets do you mind if i some counter prediction yours they follow mets come in third behind pittsburgh so the mets finish fifth but i get the expo right the offense pitch flounder drop them to fourth in the boston win the division the the world series first on second ummm i sox go on me dwight gooden rush his get blow out go on the dl from through mid-july run record the mets for give jefferies who solid in kc so i get my prediction for gooden reverse i close right jefferies though i do know the jefferies roger clemens win cy well close no in write excerpt from re nl smiley ops project for hojo i will down forbes if hojo doe not muster more ops something be wrong with projection some prediction need no introduction from mon from do you to put your prediction down for posterity you predict will get rbi i you out of your mind be impossible for type guy behind who kill most of the he doe finish why do you drive in second it his worse wise since he be either or this i predict he will be up to his previous i think he will be better rbi be not much of stretch sometimes u get lucky hit behind the entire but he finish with only rbi from tue the most prediction ever mcgwire will hit or more hr this nope he slow down the injury finish him off do even but prediction nonetheless from thu will not they will not win the division this but they will finish within five i find the prospect of two oriole win to comprehend of two sox no offense i think their pitch be good the division to offer the oriole finish seven out none of them win though might with better relief more nobody else in the division be worth they finish minimum of fifteen out the tribe to this next they wo of those the rest of the division except for the brewer who you forget you be right the rest of the division thoroughly mediocre the lead with win the red sox with win none be horrible but four be five or more below from djohnson johnson thu gmt right me i never the be cinch to clinch it but i will be more of i do think toronto should win it but i do consider cinch unless you something like with to go i do think the the best in the if we good or even we might bigger right now i think the oriole will not much better for the rest of the you win from king thu nov in you write the first only ever prediction the will win or more next you be right from fri sep jose rijo will win the cy young if he be enough to go ip who would think he would try to why risk such injury he ip but do win the cy young surprise the oriole will win in of the next the their pitch will the best in the in of the next but not the they win this one will long time to verify i do think i to long but they win they be fifth in the in not ben will not for title in the next nor will he victory either by i finish the be the before the be do doe count he will never be the pitcher he hype to be but be still decent to look like it he just too consistent to be so this look like more of the the phillies will give up fewer they get rid of their bullpen i not predict when or whether they will get rid of him you will to give the little bite of time to before see the they would fine pitch if they would just miller from pittsburg the white sox seem to the problem but not i honestly do they get rid of him their bb be down ricky will rbi if he hit in the or or spot in lineup or the spot in lineup with very good obp in the hitter this for of the next i just do think he good billy ripken will never hit over with so so good i definitely not to check this one from fri sep no lou his scout will never ever be never i never see pitcher who only strike out per inning be successful in the current seem to be to use in long relief he rubber delivery he might be decent in role from lyle sep morris division winner oriole west white sox white sox st louis west red red red wrong on of the morris my from sun oct belle will not time in belle will hit more hr he in belle hit hr time but five of those be so i but i might be right from trn tue the o go to sign of be eli weld shut outgo money only wide open for incoming my prediction which you note of be eli will defer serious on ripken until the be over eli will give every opportunity to his tumble bite from before come forth with offer despite op cy design to strength my feel be the foot left-center will cut down on power it to credibly to offer to glove deity but it be lot to offer to obviously decline but shortstop who one full of course if doe his number then eli be go to be with huge expensive problem how much do sign for when do he sign if i remember correctly he get hefty despite from thu sep of in there will be lot of mediocre much of it will not it the look for younger which to build their my specific prediction of jim cory snider will be sell side snyder be still in sf be go neither kerfeld nor presently in tiger but formerly big will be they in the nor will who he keep in with hope for shoot with never of him jody hurst will be in the they outfielder in the tiger minor system i do think they in the ron will be minor with the dunno to him it will be bye-bye for if he still he stick in the minor bo will not be hm with out bo look to get lot of pt will move to they on the net kirsch will return to to live hm for listen
