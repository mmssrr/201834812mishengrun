from greg subject re note on v series something else to consider h-r split be slg obp pretty get huge boost from his home not it could or it could he just hit lot better home he do on the see split in for i would guess some of split be due to the skydome but most of it be due just to coincidence there no to be sure of course but the only hitter the skydome seem to help lot right home run hitter be not home run hitter i you could good for them be right now t p higher only of t p bogus field which the worst defensive second in the on i think t p field something but on it come up with ridiculous result like this not be the god of field the he be but he sure be the worst in offensively t p much higher the v b i just they both very good with different strength bright future greg
