from mulder subject get more out of x how to the of x monthly post compile by mulder more cpu more disk ethernet these the response you when you how to improve the of your well more be option i wonder if more be even necessity this list be collection of suggestion from different people on the net on how you the best possible from x window on your without more be highly subjective issue the user must speed versus in order to come to decision therefore this document be be expect to subjective opinion in the objective this document be concern with x there of course other the of however they outside the scope of this document people seriously interest in the whole of system might to look the nutshell system tune by mike loukides i of the through it it look like well-written comprehensive of system i of other book ed of content introduction the other x window the x server which server lock the server into your server font the resource file define your properly client better clock for x better for x tune your client suggestion pretty picture quicker mouse think other source of note since issue new since issue introduction this document be post month on or the to the usenet news group if you copy of this which be more few month old see the you should the edition since the be if you do not know how to get those newsgroups your site doe not receive them this expire you retrieve this from site there exist usenet site to find out more them how to them see the introduction to the newsgroup post in the be this document be find there in if you do not to ftp you retrieve it by send to with the send in the body the other x b lewis the well write frequently question document it focus be on x while this on the doe the issue of speed but only with to the x server the gist of topic seem to be use it be see the x for complete window there lot of window out there with lot of different the choice of which to use be by necessity between useful this point most respondent upon twm the best for speedy window couple of generic trick you try to soup up your window be turn off thing like move if you out your window in tile you reduce the of cpu power spend in lower window joe english joe i find good font for tile be it be the biggest font i know of i use on my sun screen still get two column window side-by-side on the with no other font suggestion will be the x server which server sure your server be proper for your if you monochrome monitor use monochrome server on my monochrome sun i notice much difference between the xsun colour server xsunmono however it point out to me xsunmono be therefore should contribute to le to jonny how your server compile difference jeff u on sun system x should be compile with gcc version or with the unbundled sun compiler you expect to get very speedup in the server by not use the bundle sunos compiler i result would occur if you use one of the other compiler on the lock the server into try the x server so it be lock into doe not get eg to plock doe this help i one inquiry on this topic few pointer to the plock function but no evidence from someone who try it i not in position to give it try to eric c ecc db d your server joe english joe if you up lot of client in your xsession or sleep for second or two one i my xclients script to do this log in take le time we system without much core though this sound but i confirm it work losh imp provide me with good of why this work which i here when you up x server it huge of time to connection lot of be do by the server when it this process touch number of other process run the time would fight the server for use of the cpu more memory if you put sleep in there you give the server to get itself sort out before the client up there be lot of whenever x client toolkits register widget resource be fetch so forth this be memory intensive once this be do the process the memory settle down to use only few by use sleep to the of your client in your xinitrc you them fight other for your limit resource this be most definitely your there so to be consider number of user on your system which client you etc currently in my xinitrc i like sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i experiment with sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm i even try sleep exec then in i sleep exec xclock sleep exec xbiff sleep exec xterm sleep exec xterm the with this one to sure xinit completely finish process my xinitrc settle down into before the sleep expire my client be of these yield result so i just stick with my current setup for it simplicity you will to experiment bite to find setup which suit you font font time if you the number of font your use you get speed in time one simple be to choose number of font one one one suit you configure your client or your use client to use only those few font client should up quicker if their font be into the server this will conserve server resource since fewer font will be by the server fbm joe english joe eg my xterm font be so i twm set up to use in it menu icon etc twm font be since i do use i one font from my server oliver jones oj keep font to the them over nfs if you will extensive use of font use font server the resource file keep your xresources file on server time joe english joe one suggestion in your xresources file try put only the minimum number of resource you to to of your for reversevideo true then your resource into client-specific resource file for in your login file set the environment setenv n the frequently question excellent of how these environment work ed so when xterm it it resource from xdvi find them in so on so forth note not client follow the xxxxx resource-file you check in your system directory often to find the proper then your resource file with the this be document in the xt pg to kevin mike long mikel kevin be will his setup file to inquirer this method of your resource the follow benefit to more fewer resource store in the x server in the property side benefit your server quicker since it doesn t to your resource only process their own resource never to sort through of your resource to find the one them it the you interest in to file every time it up this doe seem to much of difference you might consider this huge boon to if you modify resource you just need to re-run the without to xrdb xrdb will by run your file through cpp when your resource split out into multiple resource file then by the client they will not out for this i c style comment in my file which cpp strip out when i switch to this method of distribute resource file i spend try to figure out why my client be not find their resource xt do not provide error when it encounter the c style comment in the resource file it simply silently process the resource file the loss of preprocessing which be very ifdef color be enough to some people to dismiss this method of resource you run into some client which the rule for neither nor xvt will find their resource if they other in when up client on doe not file with the where your resource store your client will not find it resource your resource into the server will of your client will find their resource leedom possible compromise suggestion i on try be to put resource for my use client eg xterm into my file to use the resource file method for client i seldom use define your properly client often execute on the the server in set your environment to where be the of your you should set your to or by do this you routine know the server be on the use memory method of request to j see the section of the x for further of how to properly set your i do think it stock mit but hp enough to use even when the be set rob jody goldberg jody send me xlib to stock to use even if be not properly set i do to get in the business of distribute or try to juggle non-mit so elect not to include it here hopefully mit will this minor line themselves in the if you to try it yourself jody ed client if you only few of then you should think the number of you run think the kind of you run for be there clock xclock i notice how they so the onus be on u to do the the word suggestion on better to the some of the client eg xclock xterm xbiff welcome ed i receive some from people on the subject of x client some the use of strictly xlib since xt other toolkits others u other which you use up one or more of these in this use non-xt for client the of consume the upshot of this seem to be do mix toolkits be try use just client or just xview client or just motif client etc if you use more one then you in more one toolkit know your environment think which client would work best together in environment to rob better clock for x xcuckoo suggest by on xcuckoo clock in the title of screen mclock suggest by der mouse mouse in non extensively it be to look very much like mit oclock or mostly like xclock purely by resource of course the clock one consume no resource up no screen be the one on your better for x from the file distribute with xterm hope ye who enter here this be undoubtedly the most ugly in the distribution ugly but my site it still the most use i suspect xterm be one of the most use client if not most site be there better see below if you must use xterm you try reduce the number of to reduce memory oliver jones oj jonny xvt suggest by hesketh in if you do need the esoteric of xterm then get hold of xvt it write here just to xterm be hog this write of xterm you do to your resource xvt pretend to be xterm in it current version you not bind key you in xterm i there version of xvt with this but i not find yet i recently few with xvt he question whether xvt be xterm for xvt slightly but scroll speed try this quickie dd see which scroll while xterm be slightly in requirement we do number here doe else text segment xterm requirement not experiment he rip out the tek stuff from xterm but it little difference since if you never use it it never get bring into memory so here we with some conflict report on the of xvt over xterm in emptor your if you provide some i like to see it how much occupy how much need speed of mterm suggest by der mouse mouse in i my own it be but some people like it tune your client suggestion on how you tune your client to work from scott scott come suggestion motif text field widget i notice during entry into motif text field widget i get slight in response to some keystroke the one in the field the go on with xscope i find it it seem when the resource be the focus be on text field widget or even just text widget the cursor will blink every time the cursor or in those widget the widget code be request to the server the user stop this by set the resource to it be not on but it doe little difference on slower system this specific suggestion be in to lot of consider your use client there minor embellishment be turn off thereby on server request suggestion pretty picture do use gif etc root window the more your root window the slower the server be your screen when you reposition window or etc these up cpu power i work on sun i conscious of issue i comprehend it when i see people with sun run xphoon their root window i let someone else figure out how much would be occupy by full screen root on colour if you like me you need the screen you get for client so see the root window to for remind me of this one ed quicker mouse use xset you how your pointer move on the screen when you move your mouse i use xset m in my xinitrc file which let me send my pointer the screen with just flick of the wrist see the xset for further hint sometimes you to slow down your mouse for fine work to cover my option i number of different mouse set into menu in my window for twm menu mouse set mouse set very xset m xset m system xset m xset m think joe english joe to speed up you develop there ton of thing you do some stick out for motif do set xmfontlist resource for button list et use the or or resource of the highest-level widget stick to few font possible better yet do use motif it pig do destroy widget on the fly try to reuse them this will problem with buggy toolkits too use line width of in gc on some server this huge difference compress multiple expose event this the difference between completely one just i once use better function would of xt since they use they suggest try out the gnuy but i do find the time yet i do some test on just do free the difference be indeed very time on this from ed beck noexpose event most people use blit routine but they forget to reset in the gc use for the blits this will noexpose event every blit in most only put onto the connection force the client to run through it event-loop of request this gfx context switch be see in most where only one or few gc then xt us definitely better by lot of gc with need this will remove the of subsequent request from the connection by move it the client some contributor propose seem right off the first b lewis by dbl by night how this with someone else run your on the other the other user run off your onto the other reduce context switch in the between client server i not in where i try this but i receive the follow i run on other i notice big difference i try to run on where i will reduce net with nice to reduce the of my intrusion this help lot on my poor little with only mb it when i only mb leedom the server the client compete for the cpu your server when you run it on the not problem except the client the server in synchronicity context timothy h thp firstly it rely on the most cpu mostly idle x cpu be bursty so the of you your do something cpu-intensive the time be if they not then you get twice the for your the second be context switch expensive use cpu them you price due to the of go over the network but this be offset in most by the improve buffer of network v for pipe even fewer context switch other source of volume in x window system series x window system guide be book x should nye lot more tip on in the improve x by chris d peterson in issue of the x resource version of this in the xhibition conference proceed this be for x note this list be currently by mulder suggestion
