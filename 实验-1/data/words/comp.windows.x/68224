from hildjj joe subject re help need event i understand there two method to connect code to widget the problem i now be i quite long piece of code perform lot of into window i to connect this to widget no problem so i could use function or to do this process event but the some while i the code sequence to be to be interrupt by event then i to the event resume with process the code the point it interrupt it seem to me this be possible but how i give the user the impression his input process use workproc see you should split your routnie up into chunk this be the then in the the you to your workproc the first time your workproc should be function return true when you finish when you to keep process if you return the workproc be note this method be better use time-out loop since event get process in more precedence-oriented if you use the bind i however you hose should look into joe hildjj engineer system concept
