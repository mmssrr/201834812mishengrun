build x subject why doe my sun with work with gcc be the problem it seem to produce fine code for sun except for the cgsix the new distribute with fix the problem note not know to work on subject why doe my sun with sunos know dlsym etc if you get error with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined link with ldl to your your you to surround it with ldl if you it to the since syslibs get on the otherwise you not libdl or compile the stub to joe subject be this problem build x client on sunos in sunos sun fix bug in ld which conflict with the build the xmu these symbol to be undefined when build some client compile lxmu to work to solve the problem if you use openwindows xt your sun office request the follow description openwindows libxt jumbo openwindows undefined symbol when use libxmu greg source for use with the mit develop by cek it retrofit into some fix in to get this problem the be on export in subject why gcc compile on my i use gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get when run x note first gcc on risc doe not result in it be not it be on the or here be the problem gcc cc use method of structure return them function so when gcc-compiled of x link with sun-supplied function or return structs run-time error occur include rgb the server this be from the gcc on the gnu cc us convention for structure it them by include their content in the list the compiler them effectively by reference this ought to be fix but such convention not yet support in gnu cc so it be to fix it the convention for structure return be fpcc-struct-return doe not help you duck the problem either by use cc throughout or by use it for just the routine which the problem not be solve with file which need to be compile use cc include in of the inet function use structs or return to in possibly they do involve structs collect by don subject these error run x build with gcc when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error get not support on socket server bug no screen find run the gcc fixincludes script do work you do this simple test include siocgifconf run through cc e gcc e the line of output be the piece of interest it should be modulo difference like if the gcc version where the cc version your fixincludes run do work for some or other go to your gcc source run fixincludes then rebuild the x distribution if they try run in rebuild just to sure everything get compile with the proper include file courtesy der mouse mouse subject these problem compile on the older in we find miss define for should these be the list distribute mention you these line to the file on older sunos version to compile define define define define however the should not ever the device so reference to it be remove from the subject these problem compile the x server on sunos the file be be find sun omit from sunos remove the include from it with the line define the file from version of sunos should not be copy from distribution subject these problem use on sunos of the i try to run the follow result not find or even to undefined procedure from if you build with on sun remember you need to run ldconfig root the if you x on file-server run it on the server client too while build the distribution you need to be to link exist x you might those distribute with openwindows you should sure you do not set in your environment during the build or the if you go to keep xterm setuid note the must be in or for these to work or else those must be link courtesy mit x consortium note the mkfontdir be run of the build it however to use the before they be you the error by

c preprocessor cpp to for build on system it be not specific to x the x us it to help solve number of the issue in such system widely steep curve in the process by which the system-specific file system-independent file meld to produce be not obvious there be different version of the version different you on from these source the note include on use to build x the file useful on the be guide to the by jim fulton on version of dubois dubois write useful of how work how to use it in configure x for non support system the document be from in the directory look for troff postscript some document version be now these by body of send help to see system friend of foe by mcnutt in the november issue of sunexpert should expect in june i you schwerelos by klute in ix direct need to write of this be in the x issue the x resource issue on demystify work document full of tip on be in subject where i get version distribute with the version be distribute with the some toolkits redistribute version of with their own of the file there no for such file most current contribute expect the distribute with export the distribution so you pick up without pick up the entire distribution version of but one stem from be in subject i with but no to do if you or on your system run xmkmf this be script which run for you with the correct the output be configure for your system on the then run which will use new to compile the subject why i link to the xlib routine when i try to compile i get the follow link error undefined these routine of the extension to x which introduce in the mit distribution window like the other server extension the extension will only run on server which support it server well vendor-supplied server do not support the extension in which they will window in order to use the extension you must link to the in the distribution this the include will be in the directory if you do not these file do not which use the extension be compile without it by remove the define from the you do this compile successfully your older vendor-supplied x from john b melby melby subject these problem with xtinherit not find on the sun when i run x i write on sunos or i get the error symbol not find xtinherit you see be side-effect of kludge in the to get sun work you function be both xtinherit be this by put xtinherit in the file function be use thereby it would be be in where reside these routine would be you see this error your be not doe not it be us xt function but never open connection to the x server uil this problem it other xt function the solution be to the to your the function doe not to be execute just link in your doe need xt function be correct in not it be xlib or xview in this you remove lxt from your link it should not be to link the this will solve the problem from now db subject why i compile my contrib under the new x i work well under when i try to link it under the current version of x i get this undefined xttextsetinsertionpoint there be in the widget set in to the file move into these mention in the note in this these function not xt function but of the text widget so be from xt to subject topic problem subject why doe my get the keystroke i select for sic the window control how the input focus be from one window to in order to get keystroke your must the window for the input focus to do this you must set up hint for the window if your be you use something like the follow xwmhints wmhints inputhint true xsetwmhints dpy window wmhints if your be on the xt intrinsics you set the xtninput resource to be true you to in if you do source you up the with the resource true window dxwm olwm very picky this do if you use sun openwindows olwm you this resource to your file to use client true mostly courtesy lemke of ncd of sun subject how do i figure out window be run you tell you could use could be spoof in for most you should which window be run so long you do thing in there some in which window know to do thing wrong check for hint on the window by the window so you sidestep the problem be in these it be to determine which window be run in order to of specific such olwm push-pin menu in order to give your of usurp the window function by provide even when it be miss this surely to future problem subject be there skeleton x there be no such the for the which lot of the odds end of development under window system which be use for development in x the problem be solve by use builder tool or by use cut on exist x good which you might look to when you to test just this one little thing include simple put up window sketch in it offer point for quick the in the directory in the distribution the xlib hello world in the version of this which us xlib current icccm convention post in to by glenn widener of tektronix in xt for or xm by klute show how to open multiple how to break connection be on in subject why doe not work for me sic the for retrieve resource from widget be sensitive to the type of your code be do something like this int i int sensitive oops wrong type i xtnsensitive sensitive i widget i but xtnsensitive be which on most be single byte the sensitive work properly this problem come up often when use toolkits redefine the xt type dimension position code they int will problem if those type short in you if you use the type of the resource it in the widget subject why do work you try to use these function from code they should be use only to widget these function for widget to the geometry of it child other promise function for use only by widget in this by child to request from it the only for your to request geometry for widget be to issue set some of the geometry resource this will result in the function be your code must use the or risk the widget become corrupt the xlib xmovewindow should be they should be use to xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight subject why be there like there of the current of the xt which difficult the no such exist be it undefined the set of resource for the new widget should be resource set on the in the resource should if the move should to the widget child by the time such define there would be little over destroy the old widget new widget in the correct with the desire resource set the resource correctly be the of work in new widget note be possible in the oi toolkit b lewis just the joe b lewis but not for inc dbl even
