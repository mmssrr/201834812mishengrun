objectivity present quite in the book by by the be not muslim i think he be pretty much objective in his in in the middle since he distinguish between under the of in other country like the u prior to the civil he doe not there verse in the which promote the of he doe i do think nobody deduce from these verse be will be in country now you might conveniently the of on muslim but the out there i to see the of the of lewis be to i write lewis him be give him motive for his give by see the evidence for yourself in i post some of it here if it be too long they be which some this the of tension in the empire between the the government etc we in the volume of british document on where report document concern the world be find which i check some of the incident lewis mention so i do think one to do with evidence i lewis so i comment directly upon it only speak his write in so his motif him writer on his polemic i it often quite subtle often on tell by i not you to i on trust in i urge you not to do so but to get this book it be well-known book check the evidence out for yourself the issue i be use for purpose when it prohibit sex i write the prophet himself concubine i write incident in which the prophet on someone who do not his concubine to get etc which be to the notion sex be for only in other word such in the the if be in oppose to in the of some muslim oppose by then use for purpose be oppose too i seem to be unsuccesful in get through to you be not exist institution in the century it on be free for good deed etc which be nothing new culture this good thing be the problem here but i rightfully be think their the the good so obey your one you be free but it be very i do not with muslim since they the be from god i think it be system impose on the society for of the quo of this system the of woman so their function in society boil down to be of this system etc i your point of view selim i think it be u who not get through to you some of the point you i before woman i

help this for you the prohibit drink now if person i muslim then proceed to drink bottle of beer doe this now people should drink beer of course not only idiot would think so do you see my point it be very to think the of the no the socio-economic structure they be would experience two shift in in the western culture first with the end of the the rise of commerce second with the revolution well rule the quo drive muslim country into misery try to survive in world muslim country they be to directly due to the uncomprimising economic rule in the in the rise of be model the effect you do not

lowest in the world the etc one numerous for this your theory be it be be not etc etc selim i will give you to show you the of your view if you think you obviously do of power for of history the world very powerful for section of history the world the foremost in the science so to be for be completely you try to this on history show your conclusion be there must be other for this you muslim for not follow the but i muslim for follow the well selim your viewpoint on woman in me question the extent of your knowledge of i think you not enough to be to judge whether the muslim follow the or not your be from it be poor the world the forefront of the world in science one yet somehow in your theory it be by follow the muslim in selim it be your thesis be for you conveniently overlook this which your theory while my derive from economic history you not show this you merely it so it seem to me your view on be be quite to history you so convince of your view me wonder just how objectively you try to
