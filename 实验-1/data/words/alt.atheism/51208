from ingles ingles subject re concern god evolution in jbrown write why do get etc god do life to protein code which be evolve without delve into deep discussion of v evolutionism here the problem the you outline be consistent but the evidence i with not only doe not support it but something different the by be billion old life for billion of those only be for most but the fossil evidence life be evolve in long before there be people yes there fossil show sign of mostly bone disorder of course but there some heck not just fossil evidence but we be to from genetic study show be for long long time if sin bring indirectly though then how could it exist before god the genetic code perfect without without get into the of the sin the effect of the sin for this discussion to remove from god protection since by their choice e cut themselves off from fellowship with god in their sin them to come under the dominion of who then dominion over the deletion since no longer under god protection but under dominion it no for to engineer both genetic the force of selection tend to improve the of specie the of the genetic code tend to more offset this uh i know of biologist who know more biology you to who will strongly with this there be no evidence the genetic code or other off in perfect condition it seem to to it envionment in collective sense i curious to you by of the genetic code be more complex tend to error our well-being to fight off while the simpler of virus tend to become more efficient in infection it be umm we seem to do pretty good job of to virus they to u only very of microlife be to seem to be in but the keep for bubonic use to be i sure you but it still pop up from time to time even doe do much of be of better but even when people get the the symptom tend to be le severe in the this seem to be people who be very susceptible die off long the forgive the poor terminology i engineer not doctor die off for of host i could be wrong on this but from i be only few hundred old use to be though no killer it seem to be get le hence we newborn suffer from genetic now minute i question be perfect right you we inbuilt to fight off it seem unlikely who the would gift with the to fight them off simpler to the le if he survivor i see our immune system imperfect though they presently be must be build into u by god i to be on this you god for the time when would be in by build immune system not the time of design be god our immune system of time know eve would sin their descendent would need to fight off this be more of you to but god be not responsible for even if nothing to do with the inception of evolution by would produce them since forsake god protection here do you by in the perfect without to my mind system would be of over time system will without intervention become imperfect be not perfect system imho or be it god do something like write novel on bunch of gum hold together with elmer glue be the genetic be perfect but be in inferior to be tend or would if so why could god not use better god of system could itself of do it just choose not to deletion in newborn innocent but god doe not their suffer my point i there be evidence for the you give i of but i could help few nitpick here there sincerely ingles the opinion not those of the university of ingles yet
