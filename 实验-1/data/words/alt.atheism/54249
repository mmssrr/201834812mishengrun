from mcelwre subject free-energy technology free-energy technology by robert e physicist ninety to hundred everybody know could not possibly fly it would the of physic of the expert so for simon newcomb in the no possible of know know form of know form of force be unite in by which fly long through the seem to the writer complete it be possible for the of to be few people such the wright brother do not such pronouncement the word now we for except when they orthodox physicist other scientist thing kind of energy technology use term such pseudo-science motion cite which energy not be or destroy of there be in useful energy of the physicist do not know how to do thing so they those thing not be do such principle of impotence common in orthodox modern science help to cover up inconsistency in orthodox modern theory free energy invention device which seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with out burn kind of fuel them the perfect solution to the world-wide energy crisis it pollution depletion of the environment most free energy device do not energy but into exist energy source by form of induction unlike or wind device they need little or no energy they much energy need when need energy the the sun be often block by cloud tree build or the itself or be reduce by or smog or by thick low high likewise wind speed be widely often non-existent neither nor wind power to directly power properly design free energy device do not such for three so be for motor run exclusively on seemingly into energy through the field the first two require network in order to be self-running the third one describe in in science spring motor by front cover require of but no such motor could drive electric or reversible in one home round for free complete descriptive copy of from the office jefferson hwy correct number require or try get copy of both the the your public or university dept second type of free-energy device such the motor the coil the motor of inventor joseph see science energy by induction from cycle per second plus they in the circuit which serf to the energy in the coil with the energy be it be the of the device combine to the frequency in order to the power output this output be by center the the center of strong in the of coil slip choke coil the coil will output power energy fuelless propulsion power system by john bigelow box mokelumne hill during the civil engineer viktor invent develop turbine erosion of erosion in differently develop to it describe in the book to new free-energy source by be pump by impeller pump through coil of tube until it velocity the then implode no longer touch the inside of the tube drive the pump which then convert the pump motor into electric the device seem to be energy from of the the effect like it fourth type of free energy device be the motor which be cross between diesel engine it three cylinder with compression of to engine with it burn no fuel but become self-running by drive it own compressor this engine lot of which could be use to build it very high torque it for truck prevent their slow down when climb hill mcclintock be the inventor of the drive be use to supply energy show in the trek show by insert one between it with of from source like use in common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mention here despite the it doe not fit the definition of free energy physicist joseph invent develop fusion which he which us deuterium fuel in unlimited from doe not produce be convert directly into electricity with-out turbine be construct enough to power house or enough to power city unlike the fusion monstrosity we work produce three of power for every put in new time version then there the fusion experiment be in the news conduct by university of b pons some the center in under the direction of chemist melvin mile take the trouble to collect the bubble come from such them with technique find helium which prof fusion do indeed enough of it to the excess there good the two of not so for the physicist dewey b develop comprehensive unify theory of the universe which he the system which he describe in in book such nothing but motion the universe of motion in which the universe two distinct the with continuous cycle of energy between them with-out the predict by his theory the universe much better modern orthodox theory include orthodox physicist still their be self-consistent in every some free energy device might be into energy flow seemingly convert energy into energy religious such their member the universe be only the lowest of level of existence like universe or to tv describe in book like the of the by dr johnson the key to secret world by sri twitchell for the next level up from the universe be commonly the long-time member of these group to into these higher world report on condition there it seem energy could flow down from these higher level into the universe or be the between them give the right of to it this be support by successful experiment in psycho-kinesis throughout the world such those describe in the book psychic discovery behind the iron in term of economics the inventor do not enough money other resource to fully develop free energy equipment the energy producer no desire to do so of their ve ted intere t the government be need to intervene if the government doe not intervene then the supply of energy resource from the will continue to decline will soon run out price for energy will pollution it effect include the effect smog oil spill of the by strip mine etc will continue to the government should development of free energy by inventor university production until the producer it on their own consumption by low-income consumer of free energy the effect of such government intervention would be profound the of energy from energy producer mine oil country electric utilitie etc would drop to force their employee to seek work elsewhere energy resource oil would be leave in the grind price for energy supply would drop to while the price of free energy equipment would out high but drop supply with vcr computer etc cost of produce product require of energy to produce would with their price to consumer consumer would be to the opportunity cost of electric utility bill or buy home fuel tourism would benefit would not to spend their money for for their government revenue from other fuel would to be in some other energy could no longer be use motive or excuse for energy producer would go out of business but society whole the environment ecosystem would benefit it be the people government should serve the big for more to your question etc consult my cite source book reproduction of this be robert e physic uw-ec
