from jbrown subject re gulf in write jbrown write in write yes we right-thinking folk like your good self in power it therefore deem to ten or even hundred o of in order to we win the the number of be exploit for by the news the le die in the gulf do in other of this century let this little how be the of define by number of number of country involve number of of number of both of those involve number of country too of in this i the would be the number of troop to from the in the which other we might good which news we western news in but in the cbs nbc etc the tone of the news during the whole one of those poor poor with look how precisely this cruise missile blow this build to bite this due mostly to the short couple with precise bomb technique which be possible only recently i suspect something to do with it too i how the innocent people who die in in i do you them the topic crop up if you my opinion i think the bomb of city the end of world two the most of this country commit in century bomber no hero of mine so the bomb too but to from our enlighten viewpoint here in the right then it to be million or more british die hundred of of french couple or so million of not to mention few million jew pole other people of descent in thing consider the fire-bombings the bomb be therefore justify in bring the to quick end to even loss i for one do regret it be never science but with bomb it become more with of sometimes misidentified innocent die the it be entrench ruler in their own selfish interest without for the life of other people be the be sure it the people who suffer of them the more to depose these entrench ruler in their own selfish interest or do you this to the well why the fuss not timor or even tibet if be so why be we still sell them stuff couple of week before we bomb i no or effort to justify the misguide foreign policy of the west before the it be evident the west misjudge hussein but once hussein to corner portion of the world oil supply he to be stop sure the could be prevent by judicious concert effort on the of the west before hussein but it be still hussein who be responsible for his decision to once he do so strong response from the west require your be note but you completely here you come off sound like complete idiot i feel sure not your intent your intent to sound like love well you do very good job of it well it not very love to hussein or hitler to gobble up country keep them or to them to continue with of people under their dominion so i to yes stop hussein the most love thing to do for the most people involve once he set his mind on conquest so the wrong eh i sure would work better just like it do in eh who even mention you think the be even remotely to world two i mention it if we intervene hussein to keep then it would be it be precisely the lesson the world in the western to let hitler do not stop from let hussein keep would not stop gulf to protect i guess we should fight either just think of those innocent kill in dresden yes do too you know sure truly they follow hitler in his quest for reich the consequence stem from like hussein to be stop his kind do they only the point of gun my only regret be bush wimped out do the roll into so now hussein be still in power the people not to mention the who die for i look to your incisive comment timor tibet should i them in for poor poor rodney king do you ever stop think why the jury in the first bring verdict of not guilty yes the thing i think be hmm there lot of white people in jury so it the policeman on not rodney king under they deserve jury of their peer if there be officer involve i sure their would be juror too this point of be those who be the mouth for the blood of those policeman look no further the video but the jury look the evidence evidence which you i not see when i see bunch of policeman someone who lie defenceless on the grind it to this other evidence might be so it to so when from incredulity from the revere of construct we expect revision soon just kid if there be some wonderful evidence why be it seemingly be keep secret why not tell everyone it be then everyone could oh yes you right king deserve good we could live ever i to i wonder this too but neither the prosecution nor the defense be so one not conclude either due to the silence of the in this country be intend to protect the right of the whether they be or cop one be not find guilty if there be doubt of one guilt only the jury be in position to the evidence render verdict fine but i still find it to the doubt in this i the cop seem to be someone who lie defenceless on the grind your mind-control video do tell ok it seem to me there excessive force involve the not guilty verdict me too but then i the prosecution in the first do not try to convict on of excessive force or simple which they would win they try to get conviction on of with intent to inflict serious bodily which news to murder under on the prosecution for it evident the first jury decide the officer be not guilty note not not guilty of do wrong but not guilty of with the intent of inflict serious bodily the seed of the prosecution be in their own overconfidence in verdict such they go for the most extreme they could if the the news present them true then i feel the not guilty verdict one thou not kill unless thou pretty good for kill in which thou kill kill who get in the it not be help jim brown bible for love i like the quote pretty funny i monty python you know kind of seem in vein of course oversimplify it seem but then you know jim b love
