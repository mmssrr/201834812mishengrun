from bobbe robert subject the recent rise of in this group combine with the incredible level of utter bullshit prompt me to comb through my pull out some of the best of for your i post couple of these unless group concensus i stop or i run out of good i be in the i think the follow come from john johnson but someone correct me if i wrong this be the longest of my entire collection so the prophecy be fulfil in consider the religion judge it to it it be to look it fulfil jewish prophecy the scribe be the most to out he think prophetic in the of jesus of you will see be to old often not even the promise them to the in the new we must in mind the question of the of the since the gospel be write jesus execute we do not know how much but for purpose of we will we begin of course the begin mt will son you joseph will him which g be for he will his people from their sin this to fulfil the lord speak by prophet in the of c bce king of of of on of but could not quite conquer it when the house of his court in be tell of this it the of it people shake the lord g to go to meet with the lord speak to through prophet sign of g your lord it be deep sheol or high but i wo i will not put the lord to test then then o house of be it not enough for you to men you must my god too therefore the lord himself will give you sign behold young be with child will son him which g be with u he will curd honey when he know how to refuse evil choose good for before the child know how to refuse evil choose good the of the two king you will be desert home in on just the sentence be in further he the hebrew word young virgin but this be not prophecy the it be not prophecy event to it be not prophecy virgin mother in short it not jesus use of verse out of context try to it fit the specific of it should be note if we to the prophecy in very one it be to fit virgin or not indeed young with child of course the fit be problem jesus while think of by to be g men never by the if wish to this prophecy for jesus it become best prophecy second prophecy not too convince egypt jesus birth in bethlehem tell quick elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt if he wish to liken jesus to moses this do to of the king herod mt there until the of herod this to fulfil the lord speak out of egypt i my son the lord this when child i love him out of egypt i my son the more i them my people the more they go from me they keep to the keep burn incense to idol conveniently omit the rest of but it indeed once out of egypt to return this be history jesus be not be speak of here if we to some kind of here we wind up with jesus flee resist g this prophecy be just not convince hop weep while jesus be off in egypt king herod seek to kill him thus order the execution of young child then write mt by this which speak by the prophet fulfil voice in loud weep for her child she refuse to be console they be no more the reference be to in refer to the off of into exile by of in bce the of the tribe of be to weep for her who no more it be of course since live dy before the hebrew be even in the exile it be interest to note it not who the of the the where jesus bethlehem be if should do weep for her child it be the only connexion with bethlehem be the legend it she bury north of the city on the to bethlehem for herod his it be unlikely such event occur one never know but the event be not mention or to else in the bible nor be it mention in of the record of the time herod unliked in his reign le evil deed of herod be record this might be prime of how event be to jesus life to the of the church gospel of the whole story to the of the moses in egypt it be highly likely it be device set up by to prophetic yet of jesus it be not surprise conveniently neglect to mention the rest of the quote the child the prophet of not but exile in the empire g comfort the weep the child will be return he will them together of course this would not suit purpose the child he of for good the prophecy set up be not even to who bother to check it out be not too convince the we do not even to go to the next to find prophecy egypt joseph wife the jesus to live in the city of mt speak of by the prophet might be fulfil he be first thing we notice be doe not mention the of the prophet s this time second we to who he be there no prophecy of worse there no prophecy period mention still worse there no mention in the old in the book of judge tell mother she will judge conceive son no tough his for he will be to his god from the of his birth he will deliver from the of the philistine this be of course not prophecy of jesus or the of g but it be the best be find obviously begin to go in prophecy in he be simple them up now our jesus next go people of illness mt this to fulfil speak by the prophet he take our infirmity bore our expect the verse quote in be quote out of context few word skew to fit the scheme we be surely he the suffer bear our sickness our from of the surround in we know the prophet be in present tense of the collective of choose people he to the suffer in exile in the voice of the gentile look upon it this be deeply in jewish identity of yet cherish the instrument of the by g the verse of on the sickness which the of guilt discipline they do not of go people notice the in on the sickness of the jew jesus we know do not the onto himself the verse here in not prophecy of something to come but something while it be believe jesus take on the punishment of hell he do not the illness he so while someone might to jesus the deed of in his he to miss where he intend it to it effect silent upon multitude of commoner it be jesus order them to keep quiet so he would the of the ruler mt this to fulfill speak by the prophet behold my whom i choose my beloved with whom my soul be i will put my spirit on him he will justice to the gentile he will not or cry nor will his voice in the street he will not bruise reed or quench smolder wick until he bring justice to victory the gentile will hope in his the quote be behold my whom i uphold my choose in whom my soul delight i put my spirit on him he will bring forth justice to the we will not cry or lift up his voice or it in the street he will not bruise reed or quench smolder wick he will bring forth justice he will not burn dimly or be bruise until he justice in the the his you see conveniently leave out of the it doe not suit the of jesus could never think of jesus never would the light of burn dimly but the of will indeed come to end when it job be do when the gentile come to g there will no longer be choose people but will be the child of g the end be from the the his to the christologic the gentile will hope in his while the the of the other rewrite it to fit it doctrine of believe in the if one doubt the refer to be not jesus one only to the whole the beloved but blind imperfect people rob plunder so we see when prophecy be it crumble three three night now we come upon prophecy supposedly utter by the very mouth of the god jesus himself he of his crucifixion resurrection mt for in the belly of the for three three night so will the son of be in the of the three three night before further discussion occur it be to know how the jew understand go hour long from sunset to the follow sunset refer to the period of light from to the end sunset thus to our time even until even this be why the jew their on the portion of of it seem like do forget indeed the seventh of the week thus when night refer to together hour portion hour night period be speak of thus jesus he will be in the or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three three night the good book tell u jesus crucify on the ninth hour which be he then put into the sometime then jesus leave the rise before of we the the over this be jesus use our time for in the from night to some time before morning we could little time before since the bible be not specific here this use jewish time be he in the for one two night possibly couple of hour of one this be problem for jesus prediction there be no we even to his involve three three night even use modern time we then lead to suspect this error be one of little the gospel writer put word into his god mouth no who the prediction it be more unconvincing it be counter-convincing jesus tool on of to his in story in which deeper could be find if you be one of the elect those choose to the of jesus he those who the the one he if the people not them there be no need to bother with them since they will not the better mt with them the indeed in fulfil the prophecy of which you will indeed but never you will indeed see but never perceive this people grow dull their of they shut their eye so the they would not perceive with them her with their with their turn for me to them the of his work his to the ministry this be in bce when be flourish right before it under the of see the good time end vision from g him to bring reform to be g go to this people but do not see see but do not perceive the of this people their shut their eye so they will not see with their eye or with their with their turn be then how long lord he until the city lie without house without men the be utterly the men in the though tenth will in it it will be burn like terebinth or whose stump still when the tree be fell the holy seed be it stump here we see it be g who the people of to stop listen to the prophet but the promise to solomon if you the rest of you find this be do to fulfil the of g to use light to the look we see just little portion of verse to suit his own gospel need more he the word to it fit the people who do jesus story we see verse not prophecy but from g to him in the present once prophecy on it try to jesus look like they the prophetic mt he nothing to them without this to fulfil speak of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in i will utter which be hide since the of the world botch up here he to quote not from prophet but from the p i will open my mouth in i will utter of old thing we know thing our tell u we will not hide them from their child but tell to the come the glorious deed of the lord point out the verse in the do not come from prophet you might to know copy of gospel even insert this prophet scribe the error try to cover some of it up the most of this be once the old scripture jesus he in so some will not them the in the not to be hide further they of thing know our tell u jesus with thing hide since the of the world indeed jesus in lot of secrecy confusion this be in direct opposition to the in the no wonder to rewrite them still once prophecy on their but look this prophecy the only thing begin to look excuse of little in mt we see the disciple to go out demon except in one not know epilepsy the people think those with the be possesed with demon it be no wonder the disciple be to dispossess the epileptic but jesus no more enlighten they be report to rebuke them they do enough this seem why this demon it seem either true believer or he doe not enough will someone to move of course you will find no one these move no one the only the of those rumour to on trip to mexico or some some old feel better on morning the god include jesus shroud in lore write protect from the skeptic in their they either sleep or hide in with people rumour their imminent return their of long go yet life go on of mystic story of in time or god use to themselves to men in the old too but now they silent the give excuse to why we do get to see god we too we not enough we sinful it just his we put too of our own on if we the right if we be will to meet g on his term yet even the most pious of men not see g you not see g not you know to be true i know presumptuous bold but your you know i we see religion do be people feel good content not see g they our little doe not merit u to see g sometimes they see the love in these people you worship with see the life of people be see g thus people get lull to sleep with turn g into the sight but be not see g i of it be not see g the people use to see we see in the world be good be the of the love give by men woman the forgiveness by by the mind of these the thing do these we see but it be this be so only everybody little jesus ride on shortly the role of the jewish king jesus request donkey be bring in for him to ride into mt this take to fulfil speak by the prophet tell the of behold your king be come to you humble mount on on of course the quote from little differently lo your king come to you he be victorious humble rid on on colt he will to the there be much difference here except only involve one while the poetic word slightly differently thus he jesus for both colt from version we get picture of the divine christ it to two donkey this could to we find in the write by st only the colt for bring to jesus this indeed fit the verse of properly show u in to use prophetic verse he bungle now exclude i meet i notice while christ be think to ride on the be often reverse then enter the temple the priest be people youngster jesus the but jesus reply we might expect to do mt you out of the mouth of suckle thou bring perfect it be more likely this response up since jesus never one to point out such little prophetic thing since we might expect the quote be in error which seem to fit record quite well we might jesus or you for the source o our lord how be your in the whole world you whose glory be the by you found your foe to still the enemy the the need comment there be no perfect speak of in the be there be give to g not his king not jesus mention it seem to be just one more of pen up convenient prophetic scripture yhvh to my lord jesus be to from whom the promise jewish be to be descend the jew it be king but then jesus counter by quote the lord to my lord sit my right until i put your enemy under your foot jesus be deny the necessity of descent one he be in opposition to their of course the be he but be try to some hide point to some mystery the divine of the it tempt to believe this if one be not interest in of but there problem in jesus time the think to be the it be to see why might refer to the his superior we need only look the scripture the to see he be expect to be king bring the jew to time even better those under rule of course the jew listen no good the could indeed refer to divine such the worship the problem lie in the of this error jew of jesus time one must remember there be the jew often result of different of the jesus one of these like his who think the imminent who interpret others be be the problem then yhvh to my lord sit my right until i your enemy your footstool yhvh send forth your mighty scepter from rule in the midst of your foe your people will offer themselves freely on the you your host on the holy you priest of the order of forever the word lord be often by bible to denote divinity in this lord but in the hebrew the word be no exist simply lord generic term we would use it it be use often in the scripture to refer to king to g it be merely of respect there be nothing in the text itself to imply the word refer either to divinity or to the this be suppose to be write by be not the title of the to either of or it seem fit to it to be write by court poet endorsement from g if the be write by it be unlikely he would be the the of perfect king descend from not present in we extensive of do none of which include of of the show evidence of be write long in time of the exile when g put his show of for kingdom on hold the description in the fit very well promise by g rise to power victory over his enemy successful judgement the he conquer he the priesthood common to in be righteous king to bless the people it fit we do not to this problem on though here there be not prophecy to though his use of the scripture be still this event be common to the other gospel too so we let off little more this time it be interest to note though how dress up the event the gospel of tell the with jesus simply to crowd the who the religious competition of be the of jesus question we might expect write the event end up by the such power be the pen moses jesus it together we the gospel story of to see pseudo-prophecy in john gospel the gospel story of john deserve it seem to be so remove from the event of jesus tell by even but for the moment we will just look one verse the church found religion on the jewish hope of king on extension of the promise by g when construct the history of moses write of promise of to the jewish people while this under the rule of king the who decide they would the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they on the promise kingdom john your rejoice to see my he it it would be nice to tie in for jesus from but know nothing of jesus or or i try to find event in the old which correspond to john little prophecy it be for the course to see st john up old just like his forerunner know their of it in such it be surprise they still cling to it the potter field we tell jesus while in by one of his follower write mt throw down the piece of silver in the temple but the chief priest the silver it be for u to put it in the since it be blood money so they buy potter field with it to bury in then fulfil speak by the prophet they take the thirty piece of silver the price of him on whom price be set by some of the son of they them for the potter field the lord direct me this prophecy be utterly gross of old scripture first the of the prophet it be who utter the verse which use of they weigh out my thirty shekel of silver then yhvh to me them to the the lordly price which i off by them so i take the thirty shekel of silver them into the in the house of yhvh first of the verse of do not with of the or of g the with shepherd most likely priest choose to serve function of preside over the people shortly before g would send into conflict with one the word be by the king with to the potter precisely this quote fit better but this be error the correct of the hebrew be indeed which perfect sense in context potter field be whether the or not seem to be beyond however give record one find it to resist the notion of dishonesty of course would for the text the thirty piece of silver if most seem to be the be will to the incongruity might prophecy to toss however the correct of directly the with the high priest the high priest would not put the money in the the worthless shepherd of doe the opposite of course to the bible student the prophecy present by would be new to those work be convince enough wine lot then jesus be lead to be crucify mt they him to drink mingle with but when he it he would not drink it when they crucify him they divide his them by lot it might be fulfil speak by the prophet they my them upon my vesture do they lot first of the offer to jesus be common sour wine of the type soldier we find right before jesus dy the soldier themselves give him some to drink not pollute with jn jesus i thirst bowl of stand there so they put sponge full of the on hyssop hold it to his mouth when he receive the he it be finish but seem to be on not from the prophet but one from the p i look for pity but there none for comforter but i find none they me poison for food light they put in my for my thirst they me to drink to them punishment upon punishment they no from thee let them be blot out of the book of the live of course the sour wine offer to jesus be do his request of drink this doe indeed seem to be show of pity the quote be his enemy it be not the or jesus it be then not surprise we run into further problem when we see the jesus in the g for the of the crucifiers the jesus of the gospel lk jesus forgive them the do know they do further miss with his to prophecy by bitter put into jesus drink not his the with the prophecy of the we of the of lot this bring up the which deserve discussion by itself suffice it now to the jesus clothe be divide tell be no thing it turn out this often to felon in those we will soon see it be the erroneous of the when to jesus it doe indeed bring up the interest question to the of jesus clothe for so remove from worldly possession his ownership of clothe worthy of lot some suspicion the this be to of his condition under the of his enemy it become song of to yhvh of hope out of context of it seem to fit the plight of jesus the crucifixion quite well we will the verse my god my god why you me why you so from help me from the word of my oh my god i cry by but you do by night but find no rest jesus be to cry the first sentence while on the cross this suggest the whole be jesus king of course the rest of the first doe not fit nicely to jesus or his execution jesus be not picture the whole he be suppose to be like the lead mute before it indeed jesus doe do much even when on the cross he doe not cry by both night on the cross but i worm no scorn by men who see me mock me they their he commit his to yhvh so let him deliver him for he delight in him this seem to fit jesus execution pretty well with the exception of the holy be worm bull me they open their mouth widely me like lion dog round me of evildoer encir-cle me they pierce my foot i see my bone they divide my them lose for my but you yhvh be not deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog me from the mouth of the lion my soul from the horn of the wild bull it would seem quite convince i sure the who write of this prophecy think so too this prophecy the word pierce do not exist in the the correct hebrew be dog round me of evildoer encircle me like the lion they my foot in hebrew the like the lion very verb form which pierce differ by one phonetic the word in the hebrew text be like the lion which sense in the context even further fit the employ by the writer it be convenience would urge to the word to but to the need yet weight to the prophecy this be just the choose to do while the correct doe not the from refer to jesus it doe not much for the honesty of the from the erroneous verse the doe not lend itself to jesus so verse of the sufferer be from sword cross this fit the true subject king side note we now know crucifixion do not pierce the the but the this doe much in of the think of resurrect jesus show his disciple the on his but then bind by our religious belief this time he doe not to direct link between this his lord jesus but the like others on the mind of the gospel writer when they compile the story of jesus life how much these scripture contribute to get write down be question serious repercussion for theology it be to see for those who not how some of the event in the new might be by scribe such the but it doe le to to simply prophetic so this not good thing for st the reference to the pierce look lot like jesus crucifixion john gospel recount write the tell u jesus execution jn but one of the soldier pierce his side with out blood these thing take scripture be fulfil the will look on him whom they pierce of course this be build on out of context prophet tell u how much of the of will split off from go to with them yhvh will give victory to on i will seek to destroy the come in i will pour spirit of on so when they look on him who they pierce they will mourn weep bitterly over him like you weep over firstborn child john to up prophecy be excontexts more just one john error grossly obvious here it doe not well for of the gospel writer it help to show how the prophetic of their religion be found reckon with his jesus be quickly execute for the jewish kingship to one version of the gospel jesus get execute with two thief mk with him they crucify two robber one on his right one on his leave so the scripture fulfil which he reckon with the here be try to link jesus to in the of the be not the for if one the whole of it surround one see the be the verse this go through in the not prediction of be to come in event the be think of this to fit the description of jesus the be the it still be not why execute jesus between two thief would fulfill the prophecy in jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he consider throughout his lock onto single event be poor to prophecy in this we see could better with go on to tell u how those who be crucify with jesus revile him this be to be expect from couple of robber of course in his recount st luke decide to some thing luke tell u lk one of the who with him you the yourself u this fit with recount which tell how the people who crucify jesus yourself the robber do the but then luke go on but the other rebuke the first do you g since you under the sentence of we indeed justly so for we receive the due for our deed but this do nothing wrong he jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom jesus verily i to you you will be with me in now this little seem highly contrive it stretch the bite to see this picture of one rebuke his fellow with such eloquent speech we picture of over the goodness of his punishment the justness of his suffer such noble of principle doe seem likely to be robber we wonder the of by luke of course luke recount with luke only one revile jesus not both it be enough to discount the the up but those who wish to believe it be of the error free word of g do not this open this be yet of writer try to old it reinterpret it to suit his theology in this the embroidery some problem we see the end of the world mt now come one of the most in the new it be find in three of the synoptic gospel story some of the most doubt on the whole theory of jesus mention the destruction of the jewish temple build his disciple him this the end of the world which he be the disciple tell u when will this the temple destruction be will be the sign of your come of the close of the jesus no one you for will come in my i the christ you will of rumour of for this must but the end be not yet for will rise this be but the begin of the they will deliver you up put you to prophet will but he who endure to the end will be this gospel will be throughout the whole world testimony to the then the end will come so when you see the speak of by the prophet let those who in flee to the the of those the sun will be the will from then will the sign of the son of in the tribe of the will mourn see the son of come he will send out his his elect the lesson of the fig tree soon it become tender put forth you know summer be so when you see these thing you will know he be the very truly i to you this will not until these thing but of the hour no one know not the not the son but only the therefore you must be for the son of be come hour you do not expect from this it be jesus think the world would in within the lifetime of some of his disciple he tell them he doe know the or hour it will come thus they must be wet their in to find some out of this holy error but jesus himself to explicit he tell his disciple their would still be the end they in should for it to be sweep there be some who resort to remove the of the bible the this not this of people will not of course the word for be use time to refer to the of the disciple it be interest notion when god decide to greek he do it well enough to himself but it be quite obvious from the rest of the the disciple some of them suppose to live to the end of the world the of be completely blow by look the response it become from rev peter john rev jesus he the end very for this of or ignore it for they for their execute to come of rumour of sure he be come soon surely he must be we must do be you how tire he must be sit up there be holy for just the right moment to spring so shortly his crucifixion jesus of die it be three or three three night or three period of time or three second or three of they decide for le trouble he see resurrect glow with divine then the decide it in the best interest of his new religion to stick therefore from sight into so the story go be see there be thing to jesus when people get to write the gospel story down to them jesus the fulfiller of prophecy scripture we see though this be quite but throughout church history hold to in simple belief objection could not be solve with or brute force forgetfulness keep from question to question never be the to thus for the prophecy cite in the new go on thing well continue for some time moment to consider the the doctrine of be use properly or improperly to support persecution i suppose there be one prophecy of which securely keep hold mt jesus do think i come to bring on i come to bring but sword
