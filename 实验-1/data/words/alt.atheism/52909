from subject construct logic version construct there be much on usenet the of find be poor this to provide gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improve the level of logic be the science of proof think or inference concise oed logic u to piece of determine whether it be correct or not or of course one doe not need to study logic in order to correctly nevertheless little knowledge of logic be often helpful when construct or note no be be here whether logic be the be very much open for this document merely how to use logic give you decide logic be the right tool for the job proposition or the build block of proposition be which be either true or for it be or be proposition be either to be true or deny to be note this be of deny not the the proposition be the of the not the of word use to express it so god exist there exist god both express the proposition be to quote the monty python sketch connect series of to definite proposition consist of three first of the proposition which for the to continue these the premise of the they the evidence or for the it conclusion premise or often by such since obviously so on the obviously be often view with suspicion it be use to others into suspicious premise if something doe seem obvious to you do be to question it you oh yes you right it be obvious when you the next the premise use to derive further proposition by process know inference in inference one proposition be on the of one or more other proposition there form of inference the proposition by inference then be use in further inference inference be often denote by such imply or therefore we the conclusion of the the proposition which be on the of the premise inference conclusion often by such therefore it follow we conclude so on the conclusion be often the of inference for every event premise the universe begin premise begin involve event premise this imply the begin of the universe involve event inference therefore the universe inference conclusion note the conclusion of one might be premise in proposition only be premise or conclusion with respect to the term do not sense in sometimes will not follow the order give for the conclusion might be first the premise in support of the conclusion this be perfectly if sometimes little confuse be much premise or conclusion people shower their write with without ever produce which one might describe some look like but not for if the bible be jesus must either be evil or the son of god this be not it be it doe not the premise which to support to be it conclusion it suffer from number of other but we come to those god you therefore do your duty to god the do your duty to god be not proposition since it be neither true nor therefore it be not conclusion the sentence be not be consider of the form b if we interest in b be offer evidence the be if we try to the truth of b then it be not it be for there must be something wrong with the engine of my it will not this be my will not there be something wrong with the engine this be there two type of deductive inductive deductive be one which provide conclusive proof of it conclusion be where if the premise true the conclusion must be true deductive be either or be define one where if the premise true then the conclusion be true inductive be one where the premise provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive not or however we whether they better or worse other how their premise there form of in which neither deductive nor inductive however we will for the moment on deductive they often view the most rigorous convince it be to note the deductive be doe not imply it conclusion hold this be of the slightly counter-intuitive of which we must now consider more obviously consist of true proposition however be entirely even if it only proposition for insect wing premise woodlouse insect premise therefore woodlouse wing conclusion here the conclusion be not true the premise if the premise be true however the conclusion would be true the be thus entirely more subtly we true conclusion from one or more premise in fish live in the premise dolphin fish premise therefore dolphin live in the conclusion however the one thing we not do be conclusion through inference from true premise we therefore up truth for the symbol denote be the premise b the conclusion t f represent true respectively premise conclusion inference b b f f t if the premise the inference f t t the conclusion be true or t f f if the premise true the conclusion the inference must be t t t if the premise true the inference the conclusion must be true sound be whose premise true sound therefore true conclusion be not to confuse with sound to delve further into the structure of would require lengthy discussion of linguistics philosophy it be simpler more useful to the to be when construct these know in english the term be use to refer to belief well to the to those belief this be enough but in logic the term be use to refer to form of incorrect if the or convince so for the purpose of this discussion we define which to be correct but which be see to be incorrect when more closely by study we to be mislead by them the follow list of be not intend to be to force the to force be commit when the resort to force or the of force in order to try push the of conclusion it be often use by be might right the force need not be direct from the for thus there be proof of the truth of the bible those who refuse to truth will burn in hell hominem hominem be direct the the of hominem occur when of try to disprove the truth of the the person or people the this be the truth of doe not depend upon the goodness of those it for be evil philosophy it be by communist murderer sometimes in court of doubt be upon the testimony of witness by show for he be know perjurer this be of reduce the credibility of the testimony give by the witness not hominem however it doe not the witness testimony be to conclude otherwise be to victim of the see elsewhere in this list the form of hominem be commit when person his opponent ought to the truth of of the opponent for it be perfectly to kill for food how you otherwise when you quite to shoe this be of inconsistency use excuse for dismiss the opponent this be use of reject conclusion for of course you would positive be thing you white this form of hominem when one one be conclusion form from selfish interest be know poison the well from this occur whenever it be something must be true simply it not be prove or when it be something must be it not be prove true note this be not the something be until it be prove true scientific principle of course the bible be true nobody prove otherwise of course other psychic do not exist nobody show proof they note this doe not in court of where one be innocent until prove guilty in scientific if it be know event would produce evidence of it occur the of such evidence be use to infer the event do not occur for flood describe in the bible would require enormous volume of to be present on the the doe not tenth much even if we count which be into ice the pole therefore no such flood occur in science we from of evidence something not occur we not conclude with it not occur however this be the to pity know the be commit when the to pity for the of get conclusion for i do not murder my mother with do find me guilty i suffer enough through be populum this be know to the or to the people to commit this be to to win of by to group of people this form of be often by emotive for must be it be violence woman the bible must be true million of people know it be you try to tell them they fool this be closely to the populum it consist of the more people who support or believe proposition the more likely it be proposition be correct the to us the of the to try win support for for newton genius he believe in god this line of be not completely bogus for reference to in field be to discussion of subject for we distinguish quite between stephen conclude hole give off john conclude it be impossible to build intelligent computer be physicist so we expect his opinion on hole to be inform be linguist so it be whether he be to on the subject of intelligence the of the of be commit when rule be to whose the rule be it be the error when one go from the to the specific for dislike you so you must dislike this be often commit by who try to decide every question by rule converse this be the reverse of the of it occur when one form rule by only few specific which not of possible for jim insincere therefore insincere sweep dicto simpliciter sweep occur when rule be to in which the of render the rule sweep be the opposite of non pro post hoc ergo propter hoc these know the of non pro occur when one identify something the of event but it not be show to be the for i take to god my so god cure me of the the of post hoc ergo propter hoc occur when something be to be the of event merely it before the event for the soviet union up therefore we must for the cum hoc ergo propter hoc this be to post hoc ergo propter hoc it two event occur together they must be no room for other be the s of the event petitio principii this occur when the premise the conclusion circulus in this occur when one premise the conclusion which one wish to often the proposition will be so the to be for must not be to hold government office hence government who be to be will lose his job therefore will do to hide their secret will be open to therefore not be to hold government office note the be entirely the premise be the the conclusion like the be cite the for the british secret service on employee be the we know god exist the bible tell u so we know the bible be true it be the word of god complex

where do you hide the money you steal often question such how long will this ec interference in our be to continue or doe the two more of ruinous elenchi the of conclusion consist of support conclusion when it be nothing to do with conclusion for begin by he will the of true if he then length be of help to people no how well he he will not show true such often successful they emotion which others to view the suppose conclusion in more light occur when key word be use with two or more different in the for could be more free but to sure it free user do they like with it we must license on it to sure will be freely occur when the premise use in of or be form of through shift in this the be by which of for consider we should not ill of our friend we should not ill of our friend of composition one of composition be to conclude property by the of something must to the whole for the bicycle be entirely of low component be therefore very lightweight the other of

by item for destroy tree therefore this destroy tree the slippery slope this should one event occur so will other event there be no proof the event by the first event for if we then we would to heroin we full of on therefore we not be on b be type of these occur when one to thing in some without specify in they be history upon if so then be the bible form of history be on be on so be form of form of on chemistry dog form of on chemistry so dog form of of the consequent this be of the form imply b b be true therefore be true to why it be the truth for give of the this be of the form imply b be therefore b be the truth for it why this be note this be different from non pro the the form imply b be therefore b be where doe not in imply b here the problem be not the be it be the of doe not u to deduce b convert this be of the form if then b therefore if b then this be the of something be right or good simply it be old or the it be this be the opposite of the it be the of something be more
