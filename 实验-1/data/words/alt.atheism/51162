from keith keith schneider subject re reference line trim scott d write first i the you murderer be one who commit murder well i murderer be one who commit murder for if you put bullet into gun think to someone kill with such gun the person who perform the be the murderer but i guess this be in the below definition i be interest to see more definition do you by otherwise your inductive definition doe bottom out your definition in essence be murder be the kill of someone who not commit murder his will the second occurence of murder in the we see yes it be to include the word be define in the definition but even though the series be recursively infinite i think the still be deduce i you see the problem here to do correct inductive definition you must define something in term of simpler you must one or bottom out for we define the function the function which to positive integer the product of the positive integer le or to it on the positive integer inductively follow lesson delete let look this suppose there be feud between two which the other commit some in the time member of the one kill member of the other the other think it be justify in kill member of the first now let suppose this sequence occur infinite number of time or if you do like with infinity suppose one member of the go into time begin the whole thing be there be never-ending loop of on some non-existent how do you resolve this well they murder now i suppose this be to your problem but it still be possible to reduce uninduced system in the nest murderer in the definition of murder not be infintely recursive give the finite existence of murder not be commit without kill involve so the first person to someone to get kill be murderer be this enough of induction to solve the definition see in objective system where the be such nest definition be problem keith
