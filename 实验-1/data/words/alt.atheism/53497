now no one should blindly follow but there be difference between blind follow to the opinion of someone who be more more oneself there be the of the prophet in which he the religious the trustee of the prophet long they do not concern themselves with the illicit desire of this world the prophet o messenger of god how we know if they so concern themselves he reply by see whether they follow the rule power if they do for your religion shun them i do not yet know enough the of the four sunni to comment on how this to them or to the who themselves upon them the prophet refer to the the fortress
