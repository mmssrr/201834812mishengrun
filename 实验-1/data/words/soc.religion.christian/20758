from decenso jr subject view of the trinity with permission i some here in one the order of his contribution in order to the of the view my comment on rusch in the controversy fortress i go to this clh view of the trinity second century the writer of the cent they set up much of the context for the discussion justin theophilus of know the their theology often be describe logo theology strongly on word in john they take more or le through eternity the logo with the his mind or think this word express god himself in history in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the only visible in history though the logo be present in god from eternity rusch this view be of the of the orthodox position but in form which be le it do not the to properly with the in the hold view to the however he with the he still view god one with distinction do not become fully visible except through his process of the economy the distinction present in his the holy spirit more the view should be economic though term be use below to refer to development third century clh source theodotus of socinus modern perception of god essence the unity of god denote both oneness of oneness of person the son the holy spirit therefore with the divine essence only the divine upon the jesus but he not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god subsistence the notion of subsistent god be impossibility since his perfect unity be perfectly indivisible the of god be not since the christ event the work of the holy spirit only to within god not to union of unique of the universe he be self-existent without begin or end son virtuous but finite in whose life god present in unique christ definitely not deity though his deify holy spirit of the no deity or be to the holy spirit criticism s the witness of concern the trinity deny the deity of christ of the holy spirit thereby undermine the undergird for the doctrine of in this best think of not be god be one son holy spirit see simply for the jesus the of god in the church clh source swedenborg unite jesus only perception of god essence the unity of god be he be in his essence by one person this essence be son holy spirit they different for but with the unify simplex god the three the three mode by which god himself perception of god subsistence the concept of subsistent god be erroneous confound the issue of the phenomenon of god of himself the of subsist three in oneness be refute by god be not three person but one person with three different correspond role follow one like of of fully god fully the mode or of the only unique god son full only in the sense of his be mode of the one god with his essence he be the god in sequence specific to role holy spirit god only the tile the in which the one god in sequence himself to the role of criticism s the to for it deficiency this view propound it concept of successive of the not for such of the three person christ rusch comment evidence on these belief be sketchy there two slightly different group include noetus his follower noetus more extreme follow him to use some of economic to more view come from century there seem to be some confusion between him of clh i move the follow description to be with the other third-century view it the end clh economic source hippolytus neo-economic perception of god essence the be by triunity son holy spirit the three of one indivisible the perfect unity comprehend in such deed redemption perception of god subsistence subsistence within the be by of such term distinction distribution dispel effectively the notion of or division of the deity of son holy spirit be in of the of the time doe not intelligibly in this view but it seem to be criticism s be more in it of the of the trinity note this be development of the mention with them the threeness be visible in the god himself in history however they do this be of be somehow present in the from the begin of the son holy spirit be three one in people this view be orthodox but with le develop clh origen develop further by clement to to think he set of the term of the come in he see the son between the one of god the of be the son be but he be be the between son be it not be there once when he not will the discussion for century the son be intrinsic to his concept of god the son describe though this not quite the of subsistence it in some context the union be one of love but there be some to think he use the term homoousios of the the holy spirit be by the through the son origen intent be not tritheistic but he push thing in the direction of fourth century clh often clh source modern witness other lesser know cult perception of god essence the inherent oneness of god be properly with the only the son the holy spirit discreet entity who do not the divine essence perception of god subsistence the essence of god preclude the concept of divine subsistence with threeness in oneness be self principle of monotheistic god of the only one unbegotten god who be without begin son be therefore not though he be to be he be not of the divine essence holy spirit of the he be view influence expression of god deity be not to him criticism s it be with testimony respect the deity of both christ the holy spirit it concept likewise three person with to the christ the holy spirit this result in confuse soteriology note in most version of this view the son be not fully either he be sinless distinguish this view from clh orthodox source gregory of gregory of luther orthodox perception of god essence god be be perfectly unify simplex of one essence this essence

shortcoming to do with the inherent in think itself the impossibility of describe the mystery of three in oneness in the cent there be different of which fit the description here orthodox but which different in hold to respond to be think of origen think bite too to the point of the son entity in the tend to on origen it to get of in the it on the work of with the gregory of gregory of others
