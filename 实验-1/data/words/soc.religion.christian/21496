from hedrick subject on someone refer to my on since it be post for some time i modify it since the time i this opportunity to post it there be entry in the comment by some other contributor they be retrieve from it more on the issue i give here though from point of view this post issue involve this be frequently question so i do not post the question time it occur this be to the post we get when we discussion it for since most people the question know the it the most common but not the only question with herein be how justify be give the bible it first on the definition of group believe there be to member of the sex this be distinguish from who from sex consider by most group to be however in lot of discussion the term someone in sex this be not outside the most group in this i go to use person in with of the sex i of person with who i think most people now there be predisposition to be this be often it be not know whether it be genetic or there be evidence suggest the best evidence i see be be not single phenomenon but number of different one of them be genetic there group try to help people move from be to the best-known be exodus the report i see i the just the in the minority opinion to the church report on suggest these very low success there question how even the success but there people who they convert however this issue be not it sound those who believe be wrong believe it be wrong define such by god the it to get out of be be no more the it to from be drug if it wrong it wrong it how we with people though if it very difficult to this tend to u more will to forgive it one more issue it common to quote figure of the be i one of our expert where this from here his response kinsey see below be the source of the figure percent he define by not by person on from completely to completely to kinsey one-third of one experience of post puberty ten percent of most of their experience of in the hold true in followup study do by the kinsey institute on in the seventy but not publish until the or so by bell weinberg i believe i put my on this reference but here be the online for kinsey own study it in iris the rutgers kinsey title in the by c kinsey b pomeroy clyde e publisher w b co descrip xv p cm note on survey by member of the of university support by the council committee for on problem of sex by of fund contribute by the division of the rockefeller p other pomeroy joint clyde eugene joint subject sex u s condition lc this figure be widely use in discussion even be find to hold true in other culture note in the recent newsweek coverstory be this child feb be run the round of show this promote her book refute kinsey study but the world seem to her for kook i see some objection to the kinsey study but not in enough to include here if someone would like to contribute view i be will to include it most believe sex be wrong not however few it the community church be the best-known it form to however the unite church of christ it i think couple of other group well the church seem to it some but not others in church government you find few it even southern though the number be only one or two but these few church permit church how they enforce this be issue i do doubt there of just every some more open others to the over the other issue here to the issue the most commonly cite reference by those of in previous discussion be john boswell u press the be pretty there explicit in the ot leviticus in rom seem pretty on beyond these reference there some some often cite on the subject not the sin which the of sodom propose to out not between consent there even some question whether it since the entity involve be it horrify it involve guest the responsibility guest in culture very strong this be the lot offer his it better to give up his to his guest to be if you look through for reference to sodom elsewhere in the bible you see few seem to imply their sin there jewish interpretive the sin of guest there no be wrong i do not discus leviticus the there be of set of most do not consider bind so unless nt be find lev would not settle the issue the nt reference in letter number of the reference from list of sin in which the word boswell the word occur in these list do not here he the two greek word in the list i cor i tim it be not entirely the word with of soft of in write boswell suggest likely he report the of the church include in this it refer to only in the cent come to be le frowned-upon he cite reference the edition of the identify it he prostitute give evidence none of the church understand the term refer to in more suggest by the would be mode prostitute but in his view do not intend it so for more view i consult gordon fee on i cor he cite evidence often however boswell u in greek culture be not synonymous with though it be with some kind of give boswell fee together i suspect the term be simply not very definite while it to in some it be term for while fee boswell with well he end up suggest seem the the big problem with it be the word be never use write be the first occurence the the word be compose of doe quite tell u the since it doe tell u whether the be the subject or object of the of compound word form either be give in theory it could refer to etc it to purely on etymology or you conclude goodbye be religious expression it on god by with ye however since boswell fee niv seem to on prostitute seem good guess note this miss the strong of the term however something which fee boswell on but do not to reproduce in their in my opinion the strongest nt reference to be boswell point out rom of something to people who be result of their corruption due to worship god one could this be simply if worship god he would into become however i find this force in our not seriously propose this be however i not convince rom be sufficient to for be describe in rom be not it one of whole of wickedness despite the impression leave by his rhetoric i sure doe not believe completely sex give his description of their i their sex would be so yes i do believe this view of but in the of their be reflection of the of the people not specific of my view of the be the follow i think we enough evidence to be confident of rom seem while i cor i tim not of they do not seem like word would come from someone who of or even consider it in some on the other none of these explicit on the subject rom be it refer to in the result of this be people interpret these in light of their to scripture for those who look to scripture for issue such this it not surprise they would consider these to be nt endorsement of the ot prohibition for those whose to the bible be more it be not surprise they view of something he take from his jewish upbringing without serious in the light of the gospel of this group know by now the behind these so different people tend to the mouth when they see the oppose view describe there not lot i do such number of discussion in the center the sort of exegesis of text be describe however in i not convince defender of their own belief on such the issue seem to rest on the question of whether judgement should to modern one commonly be simply never the kind of question we try to with he encounter only in context where most people would it wrong he never the experience of who try to he never who try to define which fit with of fidelity of see mirror of the between god it be to judgement on use it to judgement on these question be the follow in time with number of thing would not find it of temple prostitution it often occur between child or free people i not in position to it do but there some to think so the distinguish between the it consider for free to the this be the mode prostitute would be consider his customer would be people who enjoy the role this support the it would tend not to be in between two free not without some degree of would not condone sex with child or others who not in position to be fully responsible however fee on i cor cite some from of do seem to involve free in thus the in this should be push too be discredit for jew by some of these but there surely must be be be not prostitute do not involve or child some people be judgement i like to point out be by promiscuous sex both someone who meet for be not risk for note there be good from to doubt he would concede fully from specific on i believe his use of the genesis story would him to god however the with question provide be too quick to with this issue i the question of how to counsel be not entirely issue but one tendency we see in issue such be to be uncompromising on principle but in issue to look very the good of the people involve to insist on perfection when it would be for while believe it to he u to push people into do which they for obviously would prefer to see people in some yet if they be to do so he would see them in where they might be tempt to i believe one could view like this even while the view express in rom one believe be not god intend it occur result of sin but still conclude time we to live with it note in the story work enter life result of sin this doe stop work when we the question be whether you believe be in itself sinful or whether you believe it misfortune be in sense due to sinfulness if you will to consider the then it become judgement whether there be more by find to live with it or try to cure it the of try to cure it the most often when it doe you end up with from to suicide well break when live this be go to depend upon one of the inherent of if you believe it be very serious wrong then you be will to run high risk of serious to get rid of it we do not suggest people live with tendency to or with drug even though to cure these condition very difficult however these condition in be not so obvious for problem with problem of promiscuity not this include i for the only sort of would consider would be to in the course of discuss this over the or so we lot of testimony from fellow who in this i see of the result of effort for conversion from the report mention there our report on this question the evidence be long-term success in be enough to be on with the in to depend upon such be when conversion doe which be the people often leave in feel exclude from church nothing more to but requirement of life-long though in different context such be not for most people i think the history of strongly reinforce judgement the result be end up in the sex club the rest of the sordid side of be god but i well prefer to see people in long-term commit promiscuity with work which genesis suggest of god either i think such still be vehicle for people god love with other there issue of underlie this discussion the issue be of be when something be wrong should this be or thing wrong of specific in the culture of the time insist on prohibition since otherwise the bible become subjective be to stop u from consider everything in it when look this issue it worth note no one completely reject the concept of there number of judgement in the new even consider to be the follow judgement in the bible on prohibition interest this occur time in the ot it not in the nt but i mention it here until recently the church do consider it bind on prohibition endorsement of institution judgement of collector sinner we do not these item bind in most i believe the be one of briefly prohibition of interest be to specific society the bible try to build but not to our economy few people believe the the kind of jesus concern most people believe simply tell people how to live within but not endorse it institution for people believe the irs be to the point i try to be before prohibition to the cent we need to look whether the cent the when their different the greek would be with this be the kind of be be collector until recently prohibit of interest divinely endorse indeed be one of the more common for the between god be often or of god i not try to everything in the bible be i try to some thing therefore it be not enough to something in the bible end the discussion we need to look whether the we now the the one the bible if to there to think the prohibition still bind i will to listen those who the question doe need to be look kid themselves unless they of the minority who obey the rule list one thing worry me be the emotion this issue when you consider the of the evidence some in leviticus in rom whose subject be couple of list whose word the of concern this be seem out of proportion this should suggest to people there other simply involve this be true on both side strongly to find of discredit the to find but i help feel the bible be be use by both side of justify which come from other source this be for on the other side of the issue i would like to note some problem i with the position it be commonly present one of the most common be be determine god me i no choice i think god me be fine view for people who believe on other grind be but i do see it for people think be drug turn out to be well doe it ok most of u thing we tend to do wrong some people get others tend to be others tend to be to woman who to someone else if we view it wrong would be different of these other thing if we go to follow god we end up one time or to work to overcome u problem none of u sit god u the we we just jesus we to up our cross this concept of die to self which throughout letter seem to suggest there go to be thing ourselves we we on not to letter the experience of throughout history show u sin be in u the it be lifelong difficult the be difficult to fight doe it ok this be the where we to die to self but i like to sure those who think it be fight the somewhere else not reject the concept to fight the deeply of sin
