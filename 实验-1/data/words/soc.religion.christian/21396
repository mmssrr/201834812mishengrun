from jek subject god listmember d killie i think write in response to the suggestion genocide sometimes be the will of god god who work be evil unworthy of my worship or higgy reply in do others where be your source of by which you judge god it be often we no by which to judge god who be the to to the potter but we find view in scripture when god propose to destroy the city of sodom genesis suppose there some good men in the city will you destroy the righteous with the wicked be it from you lord to do such thing not the judge of the do right i tell the hebrew be bite stronger this be better render on you lord if you do such thing there those who the definition of good be god to but if be so then the god be good no it simply god doe he be the no one either love or obey god he be good the only motive leave for obey him be he be powerful just it sense to obey even when he tell you to round up jew them if you defy him you might end up in the yourself so it sense to obey god he the power to punish you if you do this theory i to be in to genesis to in theory our judgement worthless further discussion of or of the goodness of god however it doe not follow our judgement in still le our judgement in the course of most likely to good result when i the of the of god in history those often seem to me very different from i might expect of god who love u desire be best for u moreover the scripture consider the world i find be often very different from i might expect if it be the work of benevolent deity origen those who believe the of be the of the scripture must expect to find in the scripture the sort of difficulty they find in now some such difficulty should exist be not in itself the existence power wisdom goodness of god on the their would be such suppose i bobby fisher chess suppose every time he move i find myself nod good move just i expect him to do move i would if i be would be sign fisher be no better chess myself give he be better i expect some of his move will me think now do suppose induce him to do or even boy slip he just throw the if god the work of the universe better i do it be to be expect sometimes it will look to me if he one difference between fisher the god the control of the universe be i see the end of the chess if fisher win i revise my inference it him lose his queen move however if he lose if i see there time when he opportunity for in two move do not it then i know he be not good i think with god on the other i not in this life see the result of some of his therefore my grind for judge i see move on his must be my grind for judgement fisher in the book of genesis we joseph ten older brother who with good find him conspire to sell him into in egypt there he viceroy when there in he to provide for his when his brother nervously he tell them do not worry you to do me evil but god turn it into good i once on this text he the history of the jew be history of event look like the continue of the religion or the people or both but those event turn out to be the of the jew of the of joseph by his brother look like the of the but in it end with of the between them the drive the out of look like misfortune for them but in if they in they would with the be into their culture their oppression by the few their in egypt look like but god use it to bring them out of egypt into the promise here the people build temple offer but the destroy temple city countryside deport most of the people to you might think would be the end of the people the religion but it not live in the people be under of they turn from the worship of the lord to the worship of the fertility cult with their prostitution the put stop to never do the jew show interest in polytheism or neither the worship of the mor of the ever foothold them nor be be in of become simply system of temple the only prescribe of worship consist of come to every so often offer during the with the temple go the jew invent the of meet for study discussion of the scripture they to they be in of forget while they continue to live in god be not simply or deity not just the controller of the of or the of the jewish people but the of the world the ruler judge of everywhere time the empire by of the then of the greek or the the ruler determine to out to this end he the the study of the by one might think this would be the end of but it not the people meet for worship of the portion for the they would some from the prophet theme then discus before this time the the five book of moses genesis exodus leviticus number deuteronomy be the only book study in the if it not be for the book of the prophet would be forget his for them other here omit for brevity some of you remember julie first doolittle in the production of my when brother undertake to movie of it everyone expect julie who be so on would the role in the movie the studio decide to go with screen hepburn julie crush but she if she the screen role she would be for life doolittle type it would be for her it disney offer her the role of poppins she win for it the she stand there smile look disney she now my to the who this possible it the most line of the even in spirit we jew might the men who in the providence of god preserve keep it to this begin with joseph brother continue with two with with the meet break up one up to him you be the be you he if be to your mind then you right i it to you but i would not it to everyone for not everyone it i he without the there would be no of someone the lecture might to the conclusion god be dependent on the wickedness of men to his purpose or the think so he might then go on to suppose the wickedness be in god do he stir up joseph brother to murderous him when the be in egypt god so he oppress the people would not let them go this question how be consider wicked the time be consider something god bring i suggest of look it consider sculptor who log of wood from which he propose to but the log of smooth even throughout knot spoil the of the the sculptor consider the wood for while then the knot interruption in the color of the wood correspond to some of the so observer will how the sculptor in find piece of wood with knot like in just the right it presence be the crown touch the thing the work of in the knot from be the sculptor look for to his skill if the wood not he would still work of but different one so if joseph brother not sell him god would still bring his purpose for the jewish people but he would do so in if not jesus if his fellow not reject jesus but him the of god if follow his conscience his set jesus free it might there would be no crucifixion therefore no redemption therefore no not so god do not need sin to redeem u if do right then god in christ would still reconcile the world to himself we do not know how just we do not know how would the sistine if it interior be like just we do not know how bobby fisher would win his fourth if refuse the of bishop fisher knight do bother to look up the in question i up this but the point be none the le thus we both god use the of to his purpose the not god do would not god by justly then we to of the where god to moses i will so he will not let the people go some this to puppet with god pull the string his stubbornness cruelty be not his own work but the work of god in him i suppose god tell moses something like this if you see be not will to let the people go do not be or suppose the be out of my control my purpose will not be if choose to you let the people go well good if he doe not i will fit his into my fit it so perfectly future will suppose i would be throw for loss if obey me to return to the question this off be it possible the serb in the moslem of instrument of god will first point they do be wrong just joseph brother do wrong just do wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow bring good out of it doe not them le subject to just punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the good he would bring if the from the sin of robbery murder nor doe the good he purpose excuse u from the duty of do be right yours kiefer
