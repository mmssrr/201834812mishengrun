from jhpb joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism l write respond to simon i be interest to see some brief selection post to the net my be sspx doe not consider itself in schism or but beside the point doe the church be from provide for in here some of the theology involve for the interest there be confusion over this issue of the sspx schism often the problem be of to distinguish between true obedience obedience disobedience schism the of obedience first there element involve here for my purpose the response to the the go be such the pope order to not on or they be such the pope order to worship the god when every other full moon come the response to go it be to refuse to do be or to comply there thus possibilites response comply true obedience refuse true obedience refuse disobedience comply obedience so now you see where my of obedience come from obedience be not solely of the of the must be into it be not enough to consider someone or then whether they obedient or disobedient you to into whether the good or in my if the pope to worship the god they refuse they be disobedient the society of pius x go they refuse to comply with thing the pope desire but be insufficient to one to them disobedient you to consider the of the desire there the rub sspx the pope since ii be very thing for the church the pope of course so where we we in heresy complete with pope or the sspx priest modern luther well the only to be to who be the of the church be the problem here be very few much of of be go on the issue the religion of be defective in depth you will never the issue be discuss in the press in this country on the other one i get interview with the superior of the society of pius x will decide to side with the pope there be some soundness in this the be so some pope will this out but on the other there be unsoundness in this in in the short term the pope indeed be wrong such do nothing to help the by obey them where they wrong in if the be enough they sin in obey him the very they opportunity they to love christ in heroic the very time he need this schism let move on to schism be it schism be superset of disobedience to obey disobedient but it superset so it doe work the other not disobeyers the mere the sspx priest do comply with the holy desire doe them so be it must be to disobedience to constitute schism this something else the sspx priest you must this the rejection of the right to look in decent reference on theology you find the distinguish criterion of schism be rejection of the right to here the for not every disobedience be schism in order to posse this it must include besides the of the of superior of their divine right to from the ce schism be the society of pius x then the be no they the pope be their bos they for him every schism go this boil down to be this if we the of the of their objection their position be one the theology of obedience schism go they resist policy they think they to the of the the best interest of the church in someone who find himself in this duty to resist now be the of rome on this well if you the holy motu proprio dei you find out it the definitive document on the subject motu proprio be it not the product of letter the pope possibly never even it from the pope himself his bos be god there no one else to to in this document the holy other thing the perform by lefebvre constitute lefebvre problem of the of both confuse i to see the logic of the pope point the go i interest in of the si si no no it get to the question of jurisdiction if imply rejection of the pope jurisdiction then they would truly constitute justify under the current code of but my problem with this be this to the theology of holy order doe not confer jurisdiction it only confer the power of order the to confect the jurisdiction must be confer by someone else with the power to confer it such the pope the society bishop know the theology quite well to pretence of jurisdiction over they simply confer those require bishop the si si no no interest in it posit the the pope he do be he novel ii of holy order to this doe confer jurisdiction i lend the to friend so tell you more i believe they quote the new code of in support of this the pope think on this point to me there no there be schism to theology so why doe the pope think this the point the of go here the in question the root of this be discern in incomplete notion of incomplete it doe not sufficiently into the the live of which the second council come from the progress in the church with the help of the holy spirit there be growth in insight into the word be on this come in it come through the study of believer who ponder these thing in their it come from the sense of which they experience it come from the of those who receive with their right of succession in the the sure of truth but be notion of which oppose the of the church possess by the bishop of rome the body of bishop it be impossible to to the while the bond with him to whom in the person of the peter christ himself entrust the ministry of unity in his church motu proprio dei july it seem to me the holy be two point here be simplify to the follow council ii i the pope the be either be sufficient to prove lefebvre must be wrong he with them this be to the it would help thing more if the pope lefebvre concern in be john ii on the kingship of christ by gregory xvi pius ix leo xiii pius xi pius xii for we suppose to ignore these pope on the subject i do know the future will hold but the power be in the sspx still with rome try to thing out people would prefer to justify to obey justify disobedience or even obey god to obey obedience put u into sort of in world where word we them to schism in the church if the pope schism exist it seem to me by definition it exist it be the pope be on the wrong side of the there be no good for the to exist it will shortly be but how one deny it doe in exist it seem to me you in of destroy the thing you try to reform the power of the good will it do you if you become reconcile to the the pope in the future but in the process you destroy his to use the tool of church discipline it one thing to hold the pope misuse his power someone wrongly it something else to his do not effect the schism be in his of church discipline not tool but whose be open to it be who problem with the pope while they often object to church they the exist you now open the door to people simply ignore decision to be truly obey by disobey to be in communion while this would seem to be precisely the of divine right to you define schism clh
