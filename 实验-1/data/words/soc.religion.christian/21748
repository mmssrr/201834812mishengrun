from mserv server subject of this be of post ml siemon write for those who do think some of leviticus be for while others not even to be think it be incumbent on you in every on it own merit to determine why you pick one ignore i think the whole effort misguide no doubt i free to do but criterion to use for our judgment on this the of love for god neighbor if you not go through leviticus decide there on then your own selection from it be simply in this context it be offensive to i notice the verse forbid follow the verse prohibit to be intercourse i sorry you find this offensive it not my intent to offend i up to point which i discus in more below well so this be slimey the one i know of no one who seriously though one find joker in defense of it be to the issue do which concern within commit so your bring it up be no more the of if you not the issue you be bloody dishonest in this red herring in front of the world if you to be your business not mine to torpedo serious issue by use be in our culture ridiculous joke show you no interest in u be you to dismiss u use the you think of to do so i see you revulsion for exceed my for if i speak the you of nobody would trouble me homophobe let me this gently why you so of other people preference to no doubt i free to do i think you serious double here when you describe between slimey you implicit judgement be pervert sinful disgust in short the thing society once think not people your view you not to know sincere but this doe not they do not exist they even their own newsgroup you go to them of be mere joker i notice you delete the point of my comment the the only of occur in connection with the prohibition while there some new be condemn there none condemn one of your point seem to be be due to the of new it if this be then should not be much more by the the new no reference or to the subject i quite serious here if i go to on the of your then i go to be the to everyone else preference well if the you for be to other preference well i go to them see come up i not try to torpedo serious issue by use you ridiculous joke i post question how we should interpret guideline for i do think such question be in group the bible discus together in the context therefore i feel i good precedent for do the jesus both expound very explictly in length the linch-pin of think we require to love one else depend on christ you to the issue on those term we get in return trick to the issue i do know whether it difference but for the record this be not side issue for me i believe love one include not people to defile themselves therefore it be of high to determine whether god defile i in the new god join together couple the bed be undefiled i in the old intercourse defile person whether or not person be under the if put the old of defilement then i to know so i it to the defile person in the old i do think it right to just bite piece of the try them to still defile you but doe pretty much you right you use different but i think you the thing it be wrong to only of the to no doubt very sincere one keep show up here in every corner of usenet the world they ever do be spout these old verse which they obviously never think never even in of the issue u with the vilest of child or their perfervid mind to conjure up toss out red herring with they suppose force to to dismiss our witness without even the trouble to find out it be it not my intent to stir up such i do get upset discuss to the i i others would note i never intend to with child i merely note for the of nt of there be even of nt or even mention of which number of people on consider to be their true such should who to see truth in christ why for god precious do you people quote verse to condemn people you do know wo even the trouble to listen to before you your be love your neighbor god forbid be how you obey the to not judge or condemn others christ spend order of more time in insist on this the obscure word in you so bloody to license to do god tell you not to do why for god quote from john omit for brevity this be excellent question i you will not it mere question but will genuinely seek to discover the i recommend you begin with little introspection into why you yourself much the why do you find so you it to even mention in connection with other why do you not the verse love to the you them to be it you experience subjective feel of revulsion the think lot of people the experience the think of intercourse be it you the lot of people do you feel it the of people feel doe do you feel the bible condemn it people think the bible more to condemn it doe to condemn why then do you think with be insult to if you honestly this question you will come long why people feel the you feel note i not in sense condemn people i merely point out when i the bible i see the bible to condemn sex outside of when i i think sex sinful do you me to love my neighbor when you something disgust you disobey order not to judge or condemn others when you other guilty of sin by condemn you judge you you by yourself guilty of the offense or you i both simply note the bible sinful the judgement of the people up to god for long we of u be confuse by evil counsel from evil men tell if we to the light we would be reject some of u take to course do show sinful shun of god light bless those whose spirit be crush by the self-righteous they be justify however we see the truth the truth be the light of we now know it be not we who the light but our enemy who the light of our witness will do everything they to it with the of witness u l siemon i you god son of the ml most high of you nevertheless or you die like men ml like prince i not sure you by the two if you jesus be the truth he sinner doe not reject them then i if we be not sinner then we would not need our in christ however doe not sin be now for u we now do we nor doe christ those who refer to sin sin be or i in term here not if the bible something sin then it be not for to it sin too to i think the only definitive on be the bible if you list of everything the bible on the subject of intercourse i think you will find every verse on the list be condemn worst best the most you could the list be there be some dispute the new verse which people interpret condemn intercourse be from perspective the most positive thing you the bible of be some verse to condemn it it jesus food the council gentile be not require to keep the but nobody ever intercourse from be deserve of to be you verse describe intercourse defile both jew under the gentile not under the you some verse which best not but which some people believe in their of the sum of the bible intercourse i from experience your desire to everything simple is-ok however i do not think the bible your definitively you would like it to in i do believe it positive your yes i know the verse love one not judge one but not the issue be it you know there still thing sinful for to do since you it be wrong for to condemn you therefore the issue be whether the bible intercourse be sin even if you do the of the new verse you still leave with the the only thing the bible doe intercourse be it be defile both those who under the those who not i do think the to the with be on i think he slimey be the of connect most people who to the they of lev not bind on the be there no in the text to mix this doe not such people no limit on their conduct nor doe it they it simply their ethic doe not come from the not from lev clh
