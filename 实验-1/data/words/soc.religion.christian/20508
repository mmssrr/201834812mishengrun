from f lillywhite subject re book i send in something on this before but i believe it get lose in the weekend the describe this be improve version so no loss the first time hl the work on detect forgery of document be the write of friedrich hermeneutrik und kritik einleitende und vol of der noerdlingen beck portion of this describe in nibley the prophetic book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you to this be nibley describe who little knowledge of his subject then proceed to both the subject the nibley from work be in the form of rule for forger it interest i confess i not work only nibley thereof my short of would be require i know there be no english however i believe the technique he describe know widely enough competent could purportedly document determine if it be consistent with one would expect of genuine document of time we will not be to prove who write it but we should be to determine with confidence if it be from time culture or be forgery there type of purportedly document or copy thereof for the scroll these be test by scientific to determine the of the ink object find with them this provide pretty of the object document to be copy of work the copy itself be much more recent for we might find document which monk in be copy of something from century even be through of copists this be more of problem but still be test the test be not likely to be simple we not expect test of the of the object to tell u much so we must confine our test to the text itself it be to remember none of these test tell u if the document be it to be they only the document identify it culture of origin for i of letter suppose to be write by jesus himself to king in be now if this document be to turn up could the ink they the they could check the content write style to see if they consistent with would be expect of jew of time however even if test result be positive there be no to determine if jesus himself write it we would know time culture it from but know of jesus or other clue for must stop there there be seldom to determine who the i i no expert on work i do remember some of the test which be to copy of work we might be the document consistent doe it itself if the work it be short it would be to consistency even if it be forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it be to consistency for this most successful forger stick to short document be it consistent with the history of the time short non-specific work might not be but if the write be of length no forger would be to detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous thing which someone from culture would get right without even think it but which forger would find too numerous to check the devil be in the the style of the work figure of speech etc writer would in seem to u there such odd in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there if the document be or possibly even if somebody just when he copy it few of not from the culture be in recent copy they problem reduce to be sure but do prove forgery these test be quite effective give enough to work with but they not they require the skill of the the linguist the etc the question to be every of this document consistent with we know the culture of origin if there thing which do fit how they problem due to our of knowledge by copists or they there will often be some since we never know everything the culture the end result of such test be in the of or other copy however often it just be or the document or of it be or sometimes other this be often unsettle to on tv where problem solve in to minute with time out for it be however the world to offer
