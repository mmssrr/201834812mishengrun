from mserv subject ten or ten discourse in the course of discuss the with some folk i something completely new to me i think i offer it for comment to keep this brief possible let me my then whoever to comment on it i think i observe be the the ten use by moses be not reference to ex but reference to ten distinct discourse from ex through ex be the the ten should more be the ten discourse of which the we the ten be only the first i not completely convince the be true but for purpose of discussion let me it though i sure support the there ten in ex in order to get you to get two of them out of verse the verse themselves do not support such division they not worship other god be verse to no other god verse to not worship the idol mention in verse you verse without verse the whole be one u with only nine i could go on length this but for now i just stop with this there ten speech between ex the begin of the ten ex where god give moses the two with the ten write on them i these ten down follow in most of these begin with some of the the lord speak to moses the exception be ex which begin now these the which you to set before them the word in the the ten be the word for it the word for speech or it word often use for longer discourse for when combine with the word this word be chronicle in such now the rest of the of they not write in the chronicle of x the word for be freely use throughout the book of moses it be when moses speak of the ten x he to the word for choose word with discourse longer just single god tell moses he be go to give him the stone with the the ex yet he doe not give moses the until he finish ten discourse on mount if the ten be only ex it be not why god would nine more discourse before give these to moses on the other if we the ten discourse write on the then it perfect sense god would not give moses the until he finish deliver ten discourse when moses do get the he find both be write on both side ex if these ten be only the first verse of ex god would to write in letter not he could of course but it doe seem more likely to me this be reference to two ten discourse write in letter in ii cor seem to single out the write on stone be the ministry of which be the ministry of with the possible exception of the the it be difficult to see why would refer to the in ex be type this be le of problem if the stone should to include of the from ex through ex this the this from the it be in dt moses quote the in ex these word the lord speak he no more he write them on two of stone them to me this to identify the word just quote be the only content of the two stone my first impression however some think i note hinge on how you the these word if moses these word which i just to you be speak by god etc then would only the ten be on the stone if however moses comment these word which i now tell you be speak by god etc then quite different i do note in the dt moses tell of be give the stone before tell of the people moses to represent them before god in the exodus the people this of moses between the first second discourse before god moses the stone this reinforce the moses in dt be intend strictly of when god write point he stop to on the thing consider i find it more likely the nine in ex only the first of moses the ten discourse of god i do know if ever espouse this before it to me so while i it i would be very interest in comment criticism to offer
