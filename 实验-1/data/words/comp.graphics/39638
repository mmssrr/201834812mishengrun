from tgl tom subject jpeg compression frequently question this discus jpeg compression suggestion for welcome new since version of info on for next this include the follow section be jpeg why use jpeg when should i use jpeg when should i stick with gif how well doe jpeg compress good set for jpeg where i get jpeg viewer etc source code this color how doe jpeg work lossless jpeg why the file how do i which file i do i do it cod doe loss with some rule of thumb for convert gif to jpeg section info every jpeg user need to know section info for the curious this be post every week you find the version in the by ftp fetch or if you do ftp send to with body send other store in this for more instruction on use of the send to the with the word help index no quote on line if you do get reply the server be your return line such mysite to specify your correct to reply to be jpeg jpeg pronounce be compression jpeg for joint expert group the of the committee write the jpeg be design for compress either full-color or of scene it doe not work so well on such or line jpeg doe not nor doe it motion picture compression for compress those type of be work on by other committee jbig mpeg respectively jpeg be lossy the you get out of decompression be quite to you put in the much of it compression by exploit know of the eye the color perceive well of thus jpeg be intend for compress will be look by if you to your the error introduce by jpeg be problem for you even if they invisible to the eye useful property of jpeg be the degree of lossiness be by compression this the off file output you extremely file if you do mind poor this be useful for index view or icon etc etc conversely if you with the output the compression set you up the until you lesser compression why use jpeg there two good to your file to store color of file be big win for file network for of be to compress mbyte full-color file down to kbytes or so big difference in disk time if you gif jpeg the be more like four to one more below if your view doe support jpeg directly you to convert jpeg to some other for view or even with viewer it longer to decode view jpeg to view of simpler gif for thus use jpeg be you give up some time in order to store or more it worth note when network or phone be involve the time from shorter file be much the time to decompress the file i let you do the yourself the other why jpeg will gif usenet post be jpeg store full color million color of or le or fewer color if you only then this not seem like much of to you within couple of though gif will look obsolete doe furthermore for in section jpeg be more useful gif for people with widely color hence jpeg be more gif for use usenet post when should i use jpeg when should i stick with gif jpeg be not go to gif entirely for some type of gif be superior in file or both one of the first thing to jpeg be which kind of to it to rule of thumb jpeg be superior to gif for store full-color or of scene jpeg be superior even if you do it be lot superior if you do see section for gif doe better on with only few distinct color such line in of pixel the color compress very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg these file much gif doe without introduce visible defect this sort of be best keep in gif form in single-color border quite in gif file but they should be in jpeg file jpeg time with very edge row of pixel to row of pure-white pixel for edge tend to come out blur unless you use very high set this sort of thing be not find in but it show up often in gif file border text etc the blurriness be with text only few pixel high if you gif with lot of text do jpeg it scene for between in term of complexity the more complex subtly render the the more likely jpeg will do well on it the go for such two level should never be convert to jpeg you need level before jpeg be useful for it should be note gif be lossless for of up to level while jpeg be not if you exist of gif you wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose little if you do section which jpeg be superior to gif only if both from full-color if you from gif you lose of jpeg only thing worse however the disk justify convert this be decision you to for yourself if you do convert gif to jpeg see section for hint be to some in gif since some gifs will not convert well how well doe jpeg compress pretty well here some file for i full-color of ship in the first three file for purpose the rest be with the free jpeg describe in section file in byte comment file in ppm no compression bite or byte per pixel plus few byte ppm file through unix compress compress doe lot you note other text-oriented compressor give result convert to gif with f ppmtogif most of the be the result of lose color info gif not see sec cjpeg q highest useful set this be from the to my cjpeg q set you to look mighty close to distinguish this from the even with both on-screen once cjpeg q this slight defect if you know to look for you could tell it be jpeged without see the still good recent post in usenet picture group cjpeg q jpeg blockiness become this set djpeg blocksmooth help some still i see plenty of usenet post be of poorer this cjpeg q cut blocky but perfectly for preview or index purpose note this file be tiny the compression from the be in this jpeg file of four or five gif of the q file be every bite good the gif better if you full-color this seem to be for scene good set for jpeg most jpeg compressor let you pick file v by select set there seem to be confusion the of these set doe not keep of the some the be purely it not of the of the in use jpeg be to pick the lowest set file decompress into from the this set will from one to from one observer to but here some rule of thumb the set q be very often the best choice this set be the lowest you go without expect to see defect in try q first if you see defect then go up except for purpose never go q q will produce file two or three time q but of better if the le perfect to begin with you might be to go down to q without on the other you might need to go to higher set to further the second seem to much of the time when convert gifs to jpeg the q be right for compress but q to be better for convert gifs see section for more info if you very file for preview or index purpose to defect q set in the of to be right q or so be op note the set discuss in this to the free jpeg describe in section to on it other jpeg such use completely different some do even provide numeric just high medium low style choice where i get jpeg most of the describe in this section by ftp if you do know how to use ftp see the how to find source if you do direct to ftp server in the in or you get it by send to with send in the body the ftp list be helpful it in the note this list if you copy more couple month old get the jpeg from the if you look for viewer etc the first of this list be system-specific only run on one kind of system if you do see you for your check out the jpeg describe the end of the list note this list on free you over internet but some list too x window xv be excellent viewer for jpeg gif other it do conversion some simple it for ftp from file version be with support for other improvement however it be new still some bug lurk if you prefer not to be on the bleed edge stick with version from export note version be not good choice if you you get only color nor for convert to jpeg but work fine for convert gif other to jpeg there be glitch in version be sure to check the checkbox when jpeg file or the file will be blurry good choice for x window be john cristy free from file this process conversion the viewer correctly for it doe better though slower color xv or the free jpeg both of the complex if you just simple viewer try or xli support jpeg in it be free from file xli be version of by it to be more robust the the current xli be indeed more robust the current with respect to jpeg file it the ijg decoder while be use the next will fix this xli be free from file both to do the right thing with ms-dos this cover do for window or see the next one good choice be eric free dvpeg which view jpeg gif file the current version be by ftp from file this be good viewer work on either or the user be not but it viewer be hiview the current version be from mirror site see note below file hiview require or better cpu memory work window do not hiview be currently the viewer for no bigger your screen for it the down to fit on the screen use most viewer do you or not prefer this but there no deny it slow down of note be bite tricky the direction be colorview for do this be to either of the two it user be much spiffier-looking i find it to use more keystroke inconsistent it be dvpeg but little slower hiview on my for screen dvpeg colorview seem to be the speed both hiview the current version be from mirror site see note below file require driver if you do one look in or from the directory recent pc built-in driver so do try to driver unless colorview the driver be miss second be fullview which be kick the net for while but i do know for it the current old version be inferior to the viewer the tell me new version of fullview will be out shortly it will be submit to the time the well-known gif viewer compushow cshow support jpeg in it revision however cshow jpeg be very good it slow the speed of the viewer be poor except on hi-color too it be nice to see good jpeg in cshow from mirror site see note below file due to the of pc one of these viewer might not work on your if you get of them to work you need to use one of the follow conversion to convert jpeg to gif then view with your gif viewer if you hi-color do use gif the try to find viewer be repute to do the right thing with hi-color the independent jpeg group free jpeg converter from mirror site see note below file or if you extend memory these file do of the free source code describe in section they will convert jpeg to from gif ppm offer free jpeg gif conversion tool these slow limit to conversion to from gif in you get color output from jpeg the of these tool be they will write hsi jpeg well the jfif since file on bbs this be useful version of these tool be free prior version be get it from mirror site see note below file note do not use hsi for file to be post on internet since it be not on non-pc conversion this will jpeg file both jfif hsi to from other it demo version of version be from mirror site see note below file note the internet key site for be full run non-unix system with weird directory where this document refer to directory eg if you not on milnet you should expect slow ftp from there internet site copy mirror of the most ftp user should go to one of the mirror site mirror site be which keep file in eg if you no ftp you retrieve file from by see post in to find out how if you outside the consult the newsgroup to where your mirror be microsoft window there window of jpeg window viewer slower do viewer on the due to window system note you run the do conversion describe inside window do window the newest entry be winecj which be free extremely version be from file require window mode this be no-frills viewer with the of hog the completely while it decode the be worse other viewer but it so you use it for preview jview be good on-line help write out the decompress in window bmp but it new jpeg file it doe view gifs jview some other useful of the viewer such brightness but it excellent viewer the current version be from file mirror of this be find some other internet site include winjpeg jpeg gif tiff bmp file it write of these too so it be use converter it some other nifty include slideshow the current version be from mirror site see note file this be slow version if you register you get the version which be roughly colorview be entry this promise contender but it not be in some time this point it no over winjpeg if you to try it the current version be from file i new version will be once the finish with colorview for do dvpeg see do work under window but only in full-screen mode not in window the follow file from note check for more recent version the hobbes be not very move into their directory version of free ijg conversion version version of for with pm strong on conversion function view be bite pmjpeg port of winjpeg viewer for window see description in window section pmview viewer gif view very jpeg view roughly the speed the two slideshow function most jpeg rely on jpeg which be of the quicktime system extension so you need to quicktime to use quicktime you need or better cpu you need to be run system or if you run system you must the extension this be built-in on system you get quicktime by ftp from file of this file quicktime which be better qt in with respect to jpeg it be le prone to when feed corrupt jpeg file however some seem to problem with qt user should keep in mind quicktime jpeg be not the the jfif jpeg see section for if you post on usenet sure they in jfif most of the mention below either the first choice be jpegview free for view in jfif or gif it convert between the two jpeg the current version be big improvement over prior version get it from file require system quicktime on jpegview produce the best color of the currently jpeg viewer jpegview view in much le memory other viewer in it the only one with jpeg much over pixel on give jpegview it down to fit on the screen present scroll like most other viewer you in on desire portion though some people like this some do jpegview user be very well think out gifconverter support jfif well gif other the version be get it from file require system or gifconverter be not better jpegview viewer but it much more extensive conversion so you find it worth it fee if you do lot of with the newest version of gifconverter jfif without quicktime so it be your best bet if your be too old to run quicktime but it with quicktime note if gifconverter run out of memory try to jpeg try convert the file to gif with jpeg convert then view the gif version jpeg convert version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utility be from file this will run on but it only doe file conversion not view you use it in conjunction with gif viewer previous version of this recommend jpeg jpeg gif converter on old version of the ijg code if you use this you definitely should it with jpeg convert free pictpixie view in jfif quicktime jpeg gif convert between these you get pictpixie from file require quicktime pictpixie intend developer tool it not the best choice unless you like to fool with quicktime some of it it require lot of memory it produce poor color on le it unfriendly user worse pictpixie be unsupported it some minor bug doe not intend to fix there be old version of pictpixie pictcompressor the net if you this you should it it even buggier the quicktime kit include much of pictpixie picture compressor note picture compressor be not free not be distribute on the net storm technology picture decompress be free jpeg this old be inferior to the in but it will run without system or quicktime so you be force to use it on older system it doe need so old use it you get it from file you must set the file type of file to to picture decompress to open it if your be too old to run plus for gifconverter be your only choice for jpeg view if you do to for gifconverter use jpeg convert free gif viewer more more support jpeg not with the jfif photoshop version or write jpeg file use the jpeg plug-in from the menu you must set the file type of jpeg file to to photoshop to it most list in this section store in the there mirror site of this you should try to use the closest one in the good choice be look under plus be excellent jpeg well be tool it besides jpeg the current version be demo version be from mirror site file the demo version will crop but it be otherwise fully be renderer jpeg ilbm gif the be use to even on-the-fly from render like the current version be from mirror site file note this directory be supposedly for the will run under or viewtek be free viewer the current version be from mirror site file if you will to spend money there support jpeg two write by krehbiel the of viewtek these cinemorph morph impressive conversion edit effect prepress include cinemorph both distribute by product from inc be the most widely use for from belt system be with jpeg support the free ijg jpeg be compile for from mirror site in directory file these convert jpeg ppm gif the world be infest with jpeg on version of the free ijg jpeg to publish on it disk-of-the-month without so much notify the these vjpeg others i not even of in my opinion older ijg version be not worth the disk it store on if you such it get something newer st the free ijg jpeg be compile for st tt etc from file these convert jpeg ppm gif for monochrome st monitor try mgif which to four-level effect by flicker version jpeg file from file i not of other free or viewer for but surely there must be some by now pointer supply with risc o version convert from view jpeg jfif provision be to convert to jpeg this must be do from the cli by double-clicking recent version since of the jpeg with other while older version be find on some the current version be only by register with the john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the price dutch guilder or pound there product jpeg which provide jpeg direct jpeg view well host of other conversion process option this be more expensive but not better the dt freepost uk tel next be pd utility do some conversion the current version jpeg but doe not write it be from the next somewhere in both currently be so it to point to specific sub-directories note there be older version doe not support jpeg for system if none of the fit your you compile the free jpeg conversion describe in you need viewer if your be bite or le gif viewer will do fine if you with more color try to find viewer or ppm file there numerous jpeg offer with more pop up every i recommend you not spend money on one of these unless you find the free or too slow in product point question whether the product comply with the jpeg whether it the jfif file of the not never will be with else file if you look for source code to work with free c code for jpeg compression be from the independent jpeg group which i our source code some test file be from the site for this source code be or look under directory the current be this be compress file do forget to retrieve in mode you retrieve this file by ftp or uucp if you on pc do know how to cope with you prefer which you find mirror site see note file this file will be on compuserve in the forum go pic if you no ftp you retrieve the source from your version issue of volume if you do know how to retrieve post see the how to find source refer to the top of section the free jpeg code provide conversion between jpeg jfif file in gif pbmplus rle truevision file the core compression decompression module be reuse in other such viewer the be highly we test it on from pc to we this for both use welcome to use it the for product we do not we do for in product see the file in the distribution for we hope to this with free we offer no no the independent jpeg group be volunteer if you like to contribute to improve our you welcome to join this color most people do full-color bite per pixel store or fewer bite per pixel so it or fewer distinct color time to full-color the computer must the into set of color this process be color this be something of misnomer color selection would be better term we stick with the though color be lossy process it turn out for most the of the color much more on the do error introduce by jpeg except the very lowest jpeg set since jpeg be full-color convert color jpeg for on require color this be true for color jpegs even if you fee gif into jpeg come out of the decompressor be not color but of color this jpeg lossiness pixel little differently so two pixel with color will come out with slightly different color color get into group of color therefore be require to color jpeg on of the source the only to be to for output of this effect it to the number of color use by jpeg even if you to count the number of distinct pixel different jpeg decoder would give you different result of roundoff error difference i see post describe jpeg this tell me the poster this b convert the jpeg from gif jpegs be color or just like but number of color just be useful concept for jpeg on the other gif by definition be to or fewer color gif doe definite number of color in it the doe more entry for purpose of usenet picture distribution gif the the sender precomputes the color so recipient do to this be the of gif you stick with the sender if the sender to different number of color you you to result in much poorer if you once from full-color furthermore if the sender do use color you out of luck for this jpeg offer the promise of better for user whose do the sender jpeg full color be to precisely the user furthermore you will be to of future improvement in there be lot of in this or better to get better view of jpeg you with gif you stick forevermore with send it worth mention gif-viewing include shoddy routine if you view gif on for you get much worse you need to this be consequence of do two color one to the gif one to it but often it due to sloppiness jpeg conversion will be force to use high in order to get result in use they will directly to the number of color to be thus jpeg be likely to provide better result the gif for low-color-resolution well high-resolution one ever-growing number of people hi-color pc true on etc for these people gif be obsolete it not represent to the full of their jpeg drive these much more effectively thus jpeg be better choice gif for represent in how doe jpeg work the to know discrete cosine coefficient or entropy cod this long enough so i not go to more here for see the this be from the in file if you need help in use the see the top of this lossless jpeg there of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee do define truly lossless compression one the output be bit-for-bit to the input however this lossless mode nothing in common with the lossy jpeg it offer much le compression present very few of lossless jpeg exist of them q to the free jpeg doe not get you lossless it doe get rid of be loss in the coefficient step there be still good of loss in the color step with the free jpeg code you to turn off keep in mind jpeg not cope with the result file even with both turn off the jpeg be not lossless it be subject to roundoff error in the error be few count in one pixel it highly unlikely this could be perceive by the eye but it might be concern if you do process of this minimum-loss set jpeg produce file the of uncompress true lossless jpeg provide roughly the of compression but it bit-for-bit if you require lossless of with le bite per pixel per color component you to look into the jbig bilevel compression this perform better jpeg lossless on such jpeg lossless be superior to jbig on with or more bite per pixel furthermore jpeg be public with end while the jbig technique cover by why the file strictly jpeg refer only to of compression it doe not refer to specific file the jpeg committee prevent from define file by turf within the since we with else unless we on common file this u with problem in the of number of jpeg writer just go off to do their own thing result their with else the closest thing we to jpeg be some work be by people c-cube microsystems they define two file jfif jpeg file low-end pixel not much else tiff extension of the tiff tiff be high-end will let you record just everything you ever to know lot more besides tiff be lot more complex jfif well prove le different vendor implement slightly different subset of tiff it not likely jpeg to the mix will do to improve this both of these be develop with input from the vendor of product it likely future product will to one or both i believe usenet should jfif the for gif in picture post jfif be simpler tiff be now the tiff spec only recently be it be still on some even when be well define the jfif be likely to be widely support lowest common file never be people be interest in be quicktime for the quicktime us inside the pict structure conversion between jfif quicktime jpeg be pretty to do it see portion of section if you editor file you strip quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by see section for be these of write jfif by though they write develop by hsi this be not by non-hsi should not be use for usenet post use the j switch to get jfif output this to old version of these the current emit jfif by you still should be not to post file unless you to get by people on non-pc how do i which file i do i do it if you jpeg file your wo it likely to be hsi or some other you tell you by inspect the first few byte of the file file will with the hex ff ff follow by two byte often hex follow by if you see ff the but not the rest of it you jpeg file this be by jfif it worth try hsi file with you out of luck unless you hsi portion of the file look like jpeg but they wo decompress properly with non-hsi pict file if jpeg-compressed will couple hundred byte of follow by jfif for strip off everything before the ff you should be to it else it or not jpeg if you lucky the file consist of jpeg if you identify the of the jpeg look for ff try strip off everything before in uuencoded usenet post the jfif be begin line m uuencoded hsi file will with begin line m if you to check for the former you yourself the trouble of non-jfif file cod the jpeg spec define two different end module for the output of compress either cod or cod be the choice no on but cod produce compress file on cod produce file or percent cod the number previously cite for cod the of cod specify by the jpeg be subject to own by ibm t mitsubishi thus you not use cod unless you license from these the use doctrine people to implement test the but store with it be dubious best in the short run i recommend people not worry cod the be enough to justify the in cod should not be use for to be on usenet there be some the in the future tune for further doe loss with it would be nice if compress with jpeg you could decompress it it crop off border recompress it without further beyond you lose this be not the in recompressing lose more though not much lose the first time the next best thing would be if you decompress recompress it without it then there be no further loss you get jpeg file even this be not true not with the current free jpeg it problem of of roundoff error if you compress decompress the will to where you see visible from the output it such cycle to get visible one of the thing on our to-do list be to see if of error be or limit but i not optimistic it in the most could possibly be would be compress the unmodified full-color output of djpeg the set would introduce no further loss even such simple crop off border could further roundoff-error if you wonder why it the pixel-block move if you crop off only multiple of pixel you might be but mighty limit the bottom line be jpeg be useful for of but you do to use it for sequence of step use lossless ppm rle tiff etc while work on the then jpeg it when you to file it from you will lot of time this some rule of thumb for convert gif to jpeg you will lose some of if you convert exist gif to jpeg if you the full-color the gif from it better to jpeg from but if you need to only the gif to work from here some suggestion for get with minimum loss of the first rule when convert gif be to look jpeg to sure you with it before throw the correspond gif will give you to re-do the conversion with higher set if some gifs be better leave gifs in section in gifs with sixteen or fewer color do convert well you find jpeg file of will be the gif so check the too experience to suggest gifs the best for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most so offer the most they convert to jpeg with do your time convert gif much under kbytes do expect jpeg file convert from gifs to be those directly from full-color to you to let the convert file be much twice big jpeg file would be shoot for or the of the gif file not suggest in people develop odd of put border gif while useless this free in term of cost in gif file it be not free in jpeg file the border visible ghost edge do yourself crop off border before jpeging if you on x window system xv crop function very to do this cjpeg q set of be for full-color input but for gif input q set of to often seem to be to if you smooth suggest below the higher q set not be color gifs of or complex dither to fool your eye into see more the color gif store if you the you will see pixel often of different color the eye these pixel together to produce the illusion of color the trouble with dither be to jpeg it look like color noise jpeg compress noise very well the result jpeg file be both of lower you would get from jpeging the full color if you it to get this you to smooth the gif before compression smooth together pixel thus the color you think you in the process get rid of the color give jpeg trouble use of smooth will often let you use high q thus further reduce the of the compress file while still better-looking output you get without smooth with the free jpeg or product on it simple smooth be build in try smooth or so when convert gifs of to seem to work well for gifs dither require smooth if you see on the gif even without then strong smooth be definitely for too smooth will blur the output which you do if you process you do smooth with filter such pnmconvol from the pbmplus however cjpeg built-in smoother be lot pnmconvol the upshot of this be cjpeg smooth be good point for convert gifs but if you the you to check the result try few other set for more jpeg in or the free jpeg in the independent jpeg group
