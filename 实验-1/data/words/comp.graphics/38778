check out the mention in item below of the mention do some form of to b w conversion by the obvious but wrong method be to loop over the pixel in the source copy the pixel to the this be wrong it hole in the loop over the pixel in the the reverse to the copy pixel from the source this method be quite be use for one-to-one not just you by do sub-pixel however there be much method with include which involve do three the method for the im toolkit see below be present in pbmplus reference for by on the im toolkit in the version of the in gem see section under the title free there number of toolkits for convert from one to do simple such plus the color b w conversion here pointer to some of them xv by john conversion xv permit edit of gif file others the see the file on pbmplus by jef comprehensive conversion the version be ftp im toolkit by provide efficient toolkit the be in support pixel of component bite precision while compression byte-order independence the kit more tool with

file ftp to do forget to set mode when you ftp file for you milnet folk who still do server the ip or do not post or i ftp could someone this to me there number of server will send you thing like this in response to see item below for on some the newsgroup be for discussion of like this you find useful there document for tiff iff biff nff off fit etc you do need these the item on free get one or more of these look through them excellent the converter you be go to write be there but if you still one of the document such file by ftp from in directory these file be collect off the net believe to be correct this include pixel two object the future of this be the moment foo will no longer be it second file be now be by quincey the version exist in neither of these be complete you might to check both fit for flexible system it file most often use in despite the it not only but other thing well there be monthly fit post on it if you to know more convert between vector lot of people convert from hpgl to postscript or to cgm or it be to this be very different problem from the conversion in item convert one to be problem since once you get the file junk pixel be pixel the object the for this be not so for vector the object circle ellipsis round-cornered etc from one to except in extremely restrict it be simply not possible to do one-to-one conversion between vector there be for convert to from cgm file on the contributor it run on unix ms-windows possibly the better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other it be quite possible to do close render from one use the primitive from i know no one put together toolkit of such converter but two different hpgl to postscript converter be post to check the index on your site frequent question be how to convert from some vector to from postscript to sun or hpgl to for some of the postscript clone for pc you to render to disk file well printer the postscript interpreter in the next box in sun be use to render to file if you clever but in the be no however if someone be to put together vector to vector conversion toolkit vector to converter would be gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version include driver

number of polygon edge the the point be within the polygon if the cross even number of edge the point be either outside the polygon or within interior hole form from intersect polygon edge this be know in the the curve theorem see eric in book for more include of method be to sum the from the point to the vertex on the polygon if the sum be pi the point be inside if the sum be the point be
