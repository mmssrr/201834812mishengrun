from robert subject seek turn font outline into polygon i seek some solution on how to turn postscript type or truetype font outline into polygon be subsequently convert by renderer i be study the problem of font conversion for few but never the need to implement such system well i now the opportunity to write some font render so i would like to some of my question before i jump into the deep end the problem i be how to use the or non-winding rule to turn the outline into single outline polygon my renderer complex polygon so there be no need to reduce the polygon to simple polygon for in the letter o there two outline the outside outline which be clockwise truetype font the inside outline which be counterclockwise one common solution use by number of render be to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline the point where the two outline closest this be to descibing polygon with hole the renderer will then the hole since the interior polygon edge in the opposite direction to the outside edge i do not to use this simplistic system since it will not outline font properly it be not simple to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some font it doe not properly the or non-winding rule from my over the the proper solution be to use decomposition to convert the outline into be do by the postscript truetype font these polygon then be properly render by the renderer my question be there better solution to turn the outline into polgyons other the decomposer i not fond of this solution since it excess number of polygon question for those in the know be the best to bevel offset curve for font outline i on these subject but i tell which method be the best to implement for pointer rob robert project internet computer system institute uucp uunet university of toronto bitnet toronto
