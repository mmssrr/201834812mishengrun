from ldo university subject quicktime re rumour ok with the discussion observe speed with quicktime the effect of so on i think i do some more test first of i felt my speed test le the movie i be use only in it it version of the very first movie i with the video compressor i decide something little longer would give closer to result for better or for worse i pull out copy of odyssey i record off tv while fifteen minute into the movie there sequence where the shuttle be the i portion of second in on the i figure this would give of movement between to the difference between i it only per second to give of i the resolution of pixel with the spigot in my centris resolution from source i then import it into premiere put it through the video compressor keep the fps i two version of the movie one to resolution the other resolution i use the set in premiere specify key every ten i then the movie through the speed test i use for the result i be report result of over per second right i get much higher result with first short test movie just for fun i copy the movie to my disk it from there this time the only per second obviously the disk be contributor to the speed of i modify my speed test to the of try the movie to this time the speed over fps the poster who observe poor on see quicktime in not i try my test with quicktime but i do think it entirely with my centris system the for the movie over fps the other thing i try version of the movie with prefer see how well they from within ie with quicktime prefer of fps do work too well the very jerky this with the speed test which fps with i believe quicktime code would this much i think the slowdown come from the system switch prefer of fps seem to work fine i could see evidence of stutter fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key every second it to tell i guess i could try the movie with longer between the key to the stutter more of course this will improve the compression slightly which should speed up the even more fone computer service dept university of electric ldo new s e
