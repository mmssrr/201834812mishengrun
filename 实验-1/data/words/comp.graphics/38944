from lioness subject v e s freedome more people be for on the so here be some more info on the v the e s freedom here be the text of v e s freedom do by brown strong to freedom subsystem in of it high-level design both product use of processor for geometric both pixel router to connect this front end to second of pixel processor result freedome in both design to philosophy with respect to there however difference between the kpc e s product design freedom high-end developer system with plenty of flexibility in it freedom from two to sixteen point unit border end higher price level freedom system include fix number of pixel processor support of color blend function the freedom design it entire memory memory developer to it on flexible to number of e s provide freedom with very flexible otput video for note kpc be work for ntsc output will not require video encoder e s output however will much more flexible the kpc design in more of end-user system entry version better flexibility low-end freedom come in more price point doe not need module freedome it us deeper pipeline to support one result in better both product provide strong support for volume render kpc not user will even mix of these flexibility customer in effect to geometric pixel process to them need both implement texture price level to sgi more expensive vgxt system the only other product to provide this kpc support point of texture in but provide only support for the higher method on however provide bettern texturing e s for most from be much more kpc solution deliver more for texture process more off-screen memory for by implement texture on it module e s foces customer to move very quickly to higher price level to better texturing this problem by link texturing to it buffer module provide lower-cost more solution hope this help p this reprint without permission for the full text
