from subject re polygon routine need osprey write in idr d write kind of polygon hm more come into with routine just polygon it would be nice to know system be but processor few of the specific of the you need to give more info if you to get p i do texture if i do i for them just simple routine to do fill polygon for the processor it be for minimum of if i find good one for i polyn function clip to user-defined viewport write to in memory of course the of ok it be for be you list the you look for i think you leave out few the polygon convex they le n side you mesh door etc i believe the you get will only convex polygon be much more efficient those self intersect polygon this efficiency be to the simple convex polygon only leave right edge on line complex figure type polygon be bite trickier the le n side if it be very number like or othe to be thus for high speed i think you look for code exploit be hence limit to simple convex polygon find something like pretty remote so i guess i need the source with it oh i guess it would need to be in otherwise it be too slow i see some polygon routine in c they be too slow it for vector i be hunt high low it be they be very purpose if you limit yourself to or four side simple convex polygon i think you might be suprised how c with block move to fill line might be for polyn function in i find one i use i find one or two polyn function but my be pretty so i wo even try to rewrite them
