from subject re sphere from point spworley steve worley write bolson bolson write boy this will be if it be or give point non how doe one find the sphere be center fit those point i know how to do it for circle from point but do not see to do it in i check some geometry book gem but still loss mercy on me provide the solution it not question i do ref list this either but think it bite it should be too three of the point find the they define well the circle they lie on you you this find the center of this circle the line through this center to the of the three point through the center of the sphere with the unused point two of the point this give you two different line both through the sphere origin their interection be the center of the sphere the be to compute it just the from the center to of the point i the to you but this be good i feel this problem of with no solution worry me four point in the of no unique sphere they on the of point no finite sphere they on the of these be design design meet these problem when determine which the point on if they the should or return infinite r when intersect the two line there possibility they the line the point be on circle they different line but there be sphere of in this be with colinier point point by the point of the first line will be produce it be by if point but not on one circle it seem to me the only when the point the when the point point be test if the point be when the of the first point be find be method would be to of point the form by the bisector of line segment the center of the sphere three will form three intersect point this might be to implement steve spworley
