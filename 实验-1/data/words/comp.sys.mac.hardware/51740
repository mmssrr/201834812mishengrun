from subject re high resolution for ii in write i do know the instrutech though i to check them out but you need to be very check the monotonicity of of the bite out there the ni very specify in term of monotonicity etc the the freedom from distortion you expect from good true bite converter this be not true for the for to boorishly reply to myself i find i do the instrutech the spec to use the term loosely follow bite converter with bite to bite to no spec for monotonicity there multiplexed input the single so input not the time in the conversion spec the must be use thus for two you only unknown bite per this be poorer the instrument the bite converter no spec for monotonicity of the output it own converter the price for the converter box the the nubus the plus c driver igor xop be steep
