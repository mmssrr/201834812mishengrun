from guykuo guy kuo subject clock long here be how i modify my for higher speed previously i be use speed overdrive for my cpu but this be test out more higher speed your the top speed you not be predict before my test fine up to thus i do higher speed clock on to test higher speed clock pin ttl you will need selection of speed begin on up the cpu will run the speed the one be unit i recommend get clock in you the exist one i my clock from digikey for le some of their number ttl clock ttl clock ttl clock do get the clock they wo fit there cmos clock i try one in they work fine in iisi socket pin socket which be in the form pin dip use socket pin from style socket just cut them out of the socket cool very volt to keep the cpu cool be must my vso with modify which build onto it it connector which into the drive power you should rig up something or risk fry your cpu procedure insert here remove the top lid of the you will see the floppy disk drive mount in tower follow the of course sure the be off when you do this unplug monitor power supply cord from the of the remove the power supply by pull the interlock on the tower pull the power supply up the be piece of from the leave posterior of the tower which extend to hook on to the power supply you feel horseshoe piece the right portion of the power supply the from the tower be you need look the of the tower you will see the ribbon scsi connector to the drive power ribbon to the floppy drive disconnect these from the the drive power connector which must be to it unplug the drive lead from it mount look down the posterior section of the tower phillips screw be the remove it not to drop it into the bite of gummy glue on your screwdriver be helpful here remove the tower by pull the on the right side of the tower this prevent the tower from slide posteriorly slide the entire tower cm posteriorly then lift the tower up out of the remove the interrupt switch it be device the leave front edge of the pull the middle prong up the entire device will unplug the the on the to free it then swing it to free it from the remove the form the lift the front right corner of the mm this it to the power light guide slide the cm the then come directly out the clock it be box the cpu chip note remember it the new clock must be with pin in the very desolder remove the old clock some of the pin be bend over simply desolder then unbend them be sure your desoldering iron be hot enough before the i use suction desoldering iron to this this be not for first solder experience the be design with very fine without proper your socket or socket pin where the old once put clock into the new socket you could use the old clock but it solder on it pin this come of inside the socket corrosion problem i suggest use new clock your cool system to complete the reinsert the slide it into in the interrupt switch to lock the mother firmly plug the wire into the the tower by first the right of the tower the right of the with the tower cm posterior of it intend position lower the tower into while with the right of the once fully down slide the tower until it click into reconnect the end of the forget the floppy drive the phillips screw drop the power supply down into until it click in plug the drive light into it mount your power cord cross your finger turn on the it should the power on chord if it doe something be turn of the power recheck your if be not well you my sincere condolence hopefully will work turn the off the clock with one reboot be you will need to fully test the for hour before decide speed be truly with my vso lock-up might hour of to occur in the brief time since modify my clock hour i not single problem good luck to who this there be but risk but you could well speed or higher with le in guy kuo guykuo
