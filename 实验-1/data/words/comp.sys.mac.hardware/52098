from guykuo guy kuo subject iisi clock poll result long this poll conduct to help user decide whether or not to their iisi clock i to history possible to find some of success risk the number of reply show how this be but give the impression success be higher the previous of be to run when no on be present this be not scientific survey but it be the best we to work with to who contribute to this poll issue speed to to be the norm for without on report be to use long no on be present nubus be in use no with the nubus to go one even to with the nubus in speed of the sound be distort hi density floppy disk problem be report note unless list below be not test with higher speed clock to hence the well work higher speed one user report pull out the of one this the be one other report pull the pin out of the clock during desoldering there be one second report of user put in the with slip solder iron no report of no report of high speed then i do report from user of defective on to be problem with nubus other on be use with success see history sink modify sink these be often the style power type some use epoxy some use of sink compound with of glue there use of with bolt through the hole in the history speed the effective cpu speed of clock report cpu version be for minute before no fpu or other on cpu only on no during without nubus top speed with nubus cpu only on no floppy problem no during to boot cpu only no floppy problem no during work with the follow two fpu pdqsi b fpu video spigot pdqsi sound problem with hi density disk sound sink on cpu chip to right of cpu use fpu without difficulty pd with spectrum videospigot fpu sink on cpu hour only try system wo sink on cpu configure with pdqsi cpu on continuously no problem floppy work fine sink on cpu sink on cpu sink on cpu sink on cpu sink on cpu on hour per sink on cpu cool no floppy problem bomb soon with nubus cpu n in slot on sink to cpu no while nubus with fpu sink on cpu sink on cpu sink on cpu sink on cpu guy kuo guykuo
