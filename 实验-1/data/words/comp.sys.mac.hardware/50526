from dcb c blume subject not move enough i to throughput of sec for very mb i i nubus network pump in to memory use block-mode i high-speed disk no pb let go from disk to buffer to network it be not enough to first the from the disk to buffer then the from the buffer to then result in too slow so i try the follow scheme for step the mb from disk to buffer step send mb out the mb from disk to buffer step send mb out the mb from disk to buffer step n send the mb out the nth mb from disk to buffer step send the nth mb out even though the code doe execute the the doe not use the cpu it be use the buffer tho of the step through n long if the two be execute one so there be no improvement in the why be the so the nubus the disk driver both the time be the problem the two device disk driver both to use the bus to be there i do blume i get tire think of the thing i dcb do to do bukowski
