from fischer subject re how do they dhk write i sure intel compete for crunch-power but for give clock speed how do we the follow from to while you it where will the follow fit into the list pentium powerpc then pentium with the first version of the powerpc somewhere in the vicinity clock speed doe double the clock speed double the processor speed fill in the below no computer speed be only dependent of speed memory system speed role doe video system speed speed processor clock go up the speed of the memory system become the in the system speed if you processor it be word from memory every sure you put memory in your computer but it will cost time much the slower simms roughly the be twice give clock speed be the fischer conviction more enemy of truth lie friedrich
