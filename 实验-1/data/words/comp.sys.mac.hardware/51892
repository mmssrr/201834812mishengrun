from bgrubb grubb subject ibm info-version send follow up to sorry the but the pnews here doe not let one the i up of try this sheet be by ftp on in the ibm info-version the for this sheet be to condense the out there so people in both be they their since computer technology be there go to be point in which the sheet will be or incorrect on so just do the sheet be incomplete or incorrect but give me concise to the need correction price in u to keep this sheet provide if possible for the provide or correct keep the opinion to minimum this be sheet keep the info provide simple so i be be it to others keep the to the section correct for o code in rom be in so no more of the it be support in o disk for the section you note for proper off line this document should be in point to klossner bell-peter peter bell bill b jon wtte gsidler sidler krueger jokim john h kim mem mel strobl strobl jkirvin phill sxjcb c lewis cerro cerro joseph mel logullo jeff logullo robert irlbeck mikew for provide some of the this list possible content cpu monitor support system o number crunch network print the cpu note i only show intel cpu use in most clone for since never use the in the these chip not list only with cpu first to use cpu note both ibm use to the cpu these the speed of the cpu but not of it in most of the present there built-in while with ibm they though sell with them since there different ibm scsi video disk different effect on cpu they in iici iifx iivx seller in some iicis or iici go up to dependent i decide to them out of the list note be industry for cpu bite ibm

processor clock pclk be freq of bus clock bclk which be the one use to the chip book some compiler produce sensitive to the pclk so they if the clock doubler chip but this very compiler dependent compliers write to to of the pclk in the future it be now study such one in byte which show roughly very dependent on the o test such not of pc week the powerpcs to be in both ibm i list them to they cpu risc chip powerpc register cpu cpu bus note int speed fp combine low power for desktop system out by end of high for high end out by q int out by mid fp combine pc week pc select vender be send chip by pc week some nubus of powerpc be give to developer pc week pc week system with version out by mid pc week cpu list rule of thumb chip intel chip the frequency but intel chip higher frequency so this even out the bible ed support the between intel chip for the v chip register the limit on the bring it down to the lower chip otherwise it would to the segment v these chip come no built-in mmu unlike their successor the segment protect mode be use by window the use of the segment their put the between the in the lc strenghthens the two chip with mmus protect memory be present the only o to use the protect memory for system us this to protect disk by the memory control but this be support only on powerbooks the color lcii the in them to without the fpu use low cost solution for people who do not need the fpu only with sensitive to pclk pipelining doe the like fpu or two microprocessor with built-in fpu mmu which be implement two in the one in the only with sensitive to pclk pipelining doe the like pentium both to be but both problem these chip flounder the pc week pc pc week pc week le produce degree f for pentium pc port to powerpc chip powerpc powerpc this cpu line be to run from do window o on top of unix pink o by use or if the os themselves in how softpc or doe do in effort to remove the the system every time you something requirement for driver video system in the ibm world intel microsoft other developer work out pc week color pixel clock present support the use of color through color in rom color to edit x-bit in y bite color the color of y-bit color where x y independently or of monitor resolution dpi color to dpi or monitor type include monitor with include only video older support color ii iix iicx only color in rom need to use color to keep cost down speed up most only or bite built-in but most of those be to color presently be for dpi qx will this in in with nubus slot more then one monitor to be use in from two monitor show the thing to multiple monitor one monitor with degree of of the picture video for present non-powerbook of built-in video from color provide run color to color or sound output in since the stereo sound with the ibm even though pc rom bios definition of how the system with the video the use of driver bios video see super below of clone bios leave resolution of video o up to the o video in question in ibm clone never bother to provide for to determine mode be present nor toolbox like qd result the o must be very well write to detect some mode with some third or to use them present thing so dependent on the of the o print driver monitor edit picture of color mode o monitor one do on the be impossible with ibm for one not edit color picture do on with monitor on with color do still the color one out with ibm will processor built-in sound cd rom ethernet pc week monocrome video mode no text color color or color for the eye color from color some lower re some version could run color on the eye video color color some others these two the most commonly use mode clut from to ibm or color pixel clock mel monitor use input with ttl from etc multi-color subset of provide the of but some mode like of computer terms-dct common on the from ibm some model super this be not in the the others be but for group of video such with use their own scheme with people to be be not in effort to more of be use in the newer unit but thing still mess video be either or resolution of color common newer one since the hicolor give color some of the very newer one do bite per pixel speedwise too much some very slow western for some very for some so-so like tseng very chipset some limit overcome by vl bus be bus where the cpu look the through window etc other ibm own with function like polygon fill etc in some clone from the video though some clone model do not high end co-processors some do speed up vector-oriented like extend newer only for clone come out soon dct resolution some bpp mode function up to time in window include line bite pixel-block fill intelligent to detect co exist with other so multiple desktop like on the not be since this be it resolution color depth be fix ibm implement only color while other color through ibm license refresh up to ensure flicker free rock solid to reduce discomfort be up to on some monitor type by section for specific both ibm scsi only device common to both ibm the use of device drive printer nubus plus only some monitor cd-rom problem there lot of device which which problem for more then two devise off the scsi port scsi be suppose to be only the begin the end other set up problem for either or ibm device per scsi controller synchronous difference be due to driver be for in mode see for device per scsi controller in mode be fully tend to be implement very since it doe not require the different controller in do speed with burst with burst with burst since use driver speed such be limit to device sometimes it be require driver electronics but still use the port wide require different scsi port electronics driver from which them more expensive other scsi scsi built-in since the plus even though develop some for scsi controlers the o scsi need to be rewrite to full of the of both scsi result present use presently the only with controller chip built-in review oct though they some other of the like the wide port since other require nubus to use older nubus bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus cpu rumor-some cyclone june will come with wide port rewrite o scsi ibm scsi be not too wide yet not bundle with system except bus like the be use very by most controller out there unlike the ibm no scsi controller which result in for scsi memory with few exception the use simm memory since the plus while simms could be use in these only iicis could use of the by convension both simm type simms the iifx use simms the lc iii use new simm be by time be use in ibms the doe complete memory check by every memory if something be seriously wrong with simm the will not boot give sound chord the problem be since before feb memory on simms to be in or in set of the centris this with new memory setup memory to be one simm time if the simms the use then the memory be the two simms result in boost on printer modem built-in monitor sound input built-in on most present pd in se present non-powerbook se lc lc ii line cpu through put in with the lc bus design with one nubus be use in iisi problem some time dependency which slow through put down nubus ii bus clock cycle contiguous built-in on except the lc series the could be to use this there even plus scsi nubus support every possible from cpu to ethernet to nubus nubus ii bus clock throughput burst mode future design will be of the old quickring peer-to-peer bus use in with nubus vlbus be to of vlbus byte burst mode byte in development cpu either through the pd or the nubus unlike pd nubus cpu rocket use of multiple processor the time this be like two or more in the box to or joinly process depend on the or involve nubus need it own memory but most nubus of this type come with simms on the ibm memory simms simms some newer model do like simm memory check or or so different type of memory hd limit to drive by design or of development mfm modify frequency rll run length limit only use with drive ide device electronics synchronous currently the most common be use for medium drive more one drive esdi device throughput consider better in but not common enough for outside of drive device choice very limit to bus new problem work
