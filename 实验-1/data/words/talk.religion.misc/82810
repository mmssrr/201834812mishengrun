from decenso jr subject i post this for butler he miss it my usenet little just in he miss it here it be butler write from butler newsgroups subject re new thu i restrict this post to show the type of evidence mr decenso present his two question couple of his spurious insult my reply db by the mr decenso you should look in the index of your greek lexicon you would find the word in for lot be kleros not chorion by mr nowhere in the very discussion of kleros in do the to of the new by bromley be the plot discuss it discus the form of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc the of kleros eg plot of but mention nothing chorion or plot why doe this not surprise me thus it would seem to be very good thing you dump reference db correct himself from butler newsgroups subject re new fri i owe the group it be my to check my before their submission for error in my i by the mr decenso you should look in the index of your greek lexicon you would find the word in for lot be kleros not chorion by mr nowhere in the very discussion of kleros in do the to of the new by bromley be the plot discuss it discus the form of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc the of kleros eg plot of but mention nothing chorion or plot why doe this not surprise me thus it would seem to be very good thing you dump reference i wrong i i do not on greek thus confuse kleros the second to word in be the plot of discuss in it be chorion which be the word my greek doe not discus chorion so i not report to the of the word i do know if someone else would this though i sure someone would be to do so but i to when someone else might use to prove point my reply noble of you i do to to go to x number of source to show you wrong i chorion little db of course the only other reference mr decenso give be bullinger bullinger us such ridiculous exegisis when i mr decenso of believe bullinger he reply i misquote him you you find such exegesis convince oh my reply your misquote of me the begin of this of my response to see i in my post of this mr decenso you there benefit to our in it to to rediscover bullinger exegisis i do not you would find such unless you be convince by it my reply you for correct your of my point db mr decenso reply these not my view they bullinger we will discus the issue in post i sure i only respond to this one you direct re bullinger view it thus i for think even mr decenso could find such drek convince he should specify which of bullinger he find convince quit hide behind disingenuous of this be bullinger believe not i believe so which be it mr decenso do you find the exegisis convince or not my reply one of my purpose in these with you others be to different view of possible by bible student when i present my view i will distinguish them from now on db of course without bullinger we find mr decenso present no greek exegisis mr decenso big thing my not refer to the greek thus we find this on his for greek exegisis to be requirement my reply good point but in your these you produce only nor you dig deeper i you begin in this post i will begin greek study on these in more depth i think well db it would be to look mr decenso use evidence now we know he for he it often enough the text itself b c other pertinent scripture d context e content f other pertinent info g context h content i other pertinent info j construction k hebrew greek word study l etc but these he use or simply empty hyperbole let see he use since he be try to reconcile it to other we see he use b on the other he present no use of d context or e content or f other pertinent info or g context or h content or i other pertinent info or j construction or even k hebrew greek word study remember bullinger do count thus we find his for exegisis be just empty mouth my reply question do you find such if so do you on to use them to the best of your or will you continue to present i do this in this point in our i not find it to present of these since we seem to keep the bush not get into the core of the verse i do not believe it to use of the to refute your re in but i will do my best from this point on to use of the since you desire me to i hope you will it will our study of these db the only thing he use beyond the itself be other thus mr decenso should be honest note most of his list be red herring his only seem to be the text itself b my reply the be simple you the you the one i do not see the one they very well be source mention not be present you but we look your defense of this the of iniquity in the not be the piece of silver in you why you believe it be this begin in our we some groundwork which will be upon through deeper exegesis db of course the only i see to so reinterpret he do with be to it with so both could be consider correct my reply one of the i give different view of the be you seem to think the of be wrong in conclude these however i see no problem in tony rise of how would you the between himself in he burst open this question of the in which die be one with which we confront in our people point to the in the two obvious error some go so to the of bible be destroy by these however this be not the himself while peter tell u he fell crush by the the two indeed different but do they other doe not do not neither doe peter do not himself this be not of one person something the other person it white both be true possible reconstruction would be this himself on tree on the edge of precipice overlook the of hinnom he hang there for some time the limb of the tree or the rope fell down the ledge his body in the process the could be before or either would fit this this possibility be entirely when the of the of hinnom be from the bottom of the you see rocky to foot in height there still tree the ledge rocky the bottom therefore it be to conclude strike one of the rock on this down his body open it be to remember we not tell how long from the tree or how the decomposition of his body before his louis story of who determine to kill himself this himself on the sill of high window point pistol his he then pull the trigger from the window the time on the other person could this take his life by shoot himself while could rightly contend he commit suicide by jump form the build in this both true both true in the of peter of the of it be merely of different perspective of the event your only for reject this be i believe your to discredit you how this be impossible or highly unlikely here you in post db quote tony rise there still tree the ledge rocky the bottom therefore it be to conclude strike one of the rock on this down his body open it be to remember we not tell how long from the tree or how the decomposition of his body before his the text in this version be so you truly so oppose to such you should find it not credible but you seem to find tony rise eisegesis while reject joslin here you discredit tony on you deem too for the but you why you feel you it to reconcile the but doe tell me it do nor you show why you reject possibility question be lie or be luke lie or they both lie or either or both of them misinform why do you think there be such i do not think you ever tell u you believe in this respect db present though mr decenso only two question of me you one in represent i you to provide evidence die in the you the piece of silver in throw down in the temple the chief priest use be the of iniquity in picture in some field with therefore there be prove the piece of silver the of iniquity one the i find question to be stupid request but i will it he now restrict himself to two point first i would point out be very efficient for end life in it be bite of fluke when someone survive except in cowboy movie even then it refer to my reply i work child neglect i get re child suicide by himself his mother be on he in his be in child psych not successful to most successful this one be beg the question if i quote you night listen to the bible the institute show one of the on there use of these term you use i not with them the on the show religion logic it interest db this be so so to hang himself with no other be synonymous with he kill himself my reply time we see in ot i mention below doe this outcome do who be the only source we re himself die result to it synonymous it the boy hang himself but he live this be only one of of document we discover db now i not in this think in since mr decenso so respect include greek opinion i do some my reply you db interestingly not one of the reference i interpret the be but suicide my reply mine so it ok to use source to your point tony position do you it or even consider it possibility be it possible the source you be wrong or lie or deceive in other of their book if so should we do we do with toss them to the side not they include their of the of i sure you would find some error even some deception in those source you note they interpret the he die be very possibly true do you find in the text itself remember the first we must db this include the knowledge by my reply which i own it good source of info but not db the interpreter on volume on the bible by the one volume bible by j r dunelow word of the the bible publish by bible by i could present more well my reply i your do this we get somewhere in how we both should these more in depth study db in these reference describe the of successful suicide thus i only conclude the greek word ie oneself be successful my reply mine no you only conclude this tony this highly outcome but doe not be result the greek word be be it only occurrence in the new in the the greek of the ot use the time of jesus it only use in now when his not follow he donkey go home to his house to his city then he put his household in order himself die he bury in his tomb notice not only be it himself gr sept but it explicitly die here we no doubt of the result in we not explicitly tell die there be nothing in the greek to suggest success or it simply oneself db but mr decenso you more welcome to show more insist the not successful my reply mine you one never err insist the unsuccessful be do even by me i in post i still with tony exegesis be the most into i recently notice some new thing in then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple go himself but the chief priest take the silver piece it be not to put them into the they the price of blood they consult together buy with them the potter field to bury in therefore field be the field of blood to this first of notice the text doe not die result of it be he go himself luke however in tell u he burst open in the middle his gush out this be pretty with the other give in peter speech the need to pick new etc he so the whole concept luke both recount be highly but not cut i write my reply here we stickler i to i just recently notice let look the in i sin by innocent blood they be to u you see to it then he throw down the piece of silver in the temple go himself but the chief priest take the silver piece it be not to put them into the they the price of blood they consult together buy with them the potter field to bury in therefore field be the field of blood to this notice verse then he go himself doe not die doe it should we he die result of the doe now this field with the of iniquity he burst open in the middle his gush out for it be write in the book of his dwell be let no one live in it his office here we of so my line of to dispel your myth re the two of be this doe how die he doe himself but he do die in the incident however seem to show u his demise therefore there be no between re my reply we do know from he do himself record his it possible he fell from the hit some rock thereby burst open i no longer to be the therefore no do not die result of the do he most believe he do but i quote to show i highly the but in look the text we die it be however highly db by the while die from the the book different of with the we discuss one simply ignore it entirely simply refer to version the correct version in both the knowledge suggest the hypothesis hang then when he rot his belly explode which doe his or his or rope break he fell to his his gut gush out which doe how would foot first my reply the outcome of be dependent upon how high the person suspend before the obstruction such tree the how steep incline of rocky the victim fell upon thus possibly roll or bounce of rock etc in of the the we not give lot of info on the specific but tony in the quote post u some possible reconstruction would be this himself on tree on the edge of precipice overlook the of hinnom he hang there for some time the limb of the tree or the rope fell down the ledge his body in the process the could be before or either would fit this this possibility be entirely when the of the of hinnom be from the bottom of the you see rocky to foot in height there still tree the ledge rocky the bottom therefore it be to conclude strike one of the rock on this down his body open db now truthfully i do not see be comfort confuse the source of the potter field prophesy but on the other the be correct doe confusion of course who every word of the bible be true by god will to thereby one more to the of ie where the prophesy of the potter field from my reply when we do with this study on his remind me to discus this with you db to your second question mr decenso you how we could be sure the money with which the indeed for the some other source i would point out in where it mention the of iniquity it mention of iniquity they be ie concern who guide to those who jesus now i would point out when the bible describe of iniquity then discus the of iniquity it would be to suggest it of iniquity other the one discuss my reply we get somewhere we in those peter stand up in the midst of the disciple the number of hundred twenty men brother this scripture to be fulfil which the holy spirit speak before by the mouth of concern who guide to those who jesus for he number with u in this ministry now this field with the of iniquity he burst open in the middle his gush out it know to those dwell in so field be in their own be field of blood for it be write in the book of his dwell be let no one live in it his office notice in verse the word iniquity be not use it guide to those who jesus but the writer do not stop there v for he number with u in this ministry do in their ministry joh this he not he for the poor but he thief the money box he use to put in it joh for some think the money box jesus to him buy those thing we need for the or he should give something to the poor so now we know he per se right peter in this ministry to john then luke the of of iniquity money should be put into the ministry but steal by to field i believe this be better of the of iniquity do you think db now since i give you even reference you could type of you of me type i think you you do to mr joslin my reply i will i complete i do not big problem with the limit view if one wish to contend with him he could not him one time out of job
