from mcelwre subject physic the follow of theory of the universe include little-known description of the of our system physic orthodox physicist to be look for unify field theory in which of the force of the universe be with single set of or but they be ignore or suppress excellent one for the physicist dewey b comprehensive unify theory of the universe which he the system be build on two the of time the universe be compose entirely of one component motion exist in three dimension in discrete unit in two form time the universe conform to the of it it geometry be from these two develop complete universe use of motion the concept of motion speed in to the speed of light which unit velocity the step in the development to object in his universe with object in the universe photon incomplete molecule cluster system system white etc even object not yet discover then such explode burst his theory to his new model of the to precisely inter in molecule compressibility of solid other property of of this be describe in good with-out complex in his book book of dewey b the follow be complete list of the physicist dewey b book his comprehensive unify theory of the universe some of the book out of print now but still through the structure of the universe the the beyond newton new light on time nothing but motion substitute for the billion super collider the four bond the neglect of science the universe of motion solution to most mystery property of but the of these book be publish by north publisher box or should be if your university or public doe of them of them include the one from the society of unify science isus e city this be the to promote theory they other include the reciprocity physicist dewey b physicist dewey b retire engineer or he old when he die in he of science degree in engineer science from oregon university he develop his comprehensive unify theory of the universe while try to develop to compute property only on the element use of degree might be one orthodox physicist ignore him but it be not sometimes it outsider to see the forest through the tree the time it be from his book he know orthodox physic well physicist or well enough to point out their hoc principle of impotence in-consistencies etc do not the fund etc to test his theory it not for him to do so he simply the of his theory with other in his fit better self-consistent theory be much more the orthodox physicist they to be look for unify field theory work but be ignore one for over now modern physic doe not the universe so well some of some of book full of of orthodox physicist who remember epicycle sphere geocentricity theory etc once seem to it well but be prove wrong prof h meyer professor emeritus of uw-superior strong proponent of theory or still be president of the society of unify science editor of their reciprocity he move to retire super collider boondoggle i contruction of the superconducting super collider in or else it would be gross of money contribute nothing of scientific most physicist do it but to the comprehensive unify theory of the physicist dewey b describe in his book the goofy meson hyperon etc which they find in exist collider fermi cern etc just of which by the high-energy collide which quickly like cosmic they with their environment more expensive collider will only few more element of the physicist not see there before the physicist will be even more confuse they now few more type of worth the billion cost do we much more us for this money thing to consider be the propose in serious grow problem with some kind of fire the off underground how much poison of the grind grind with insecticide will be require to keep the out of the supercollider the super collider propose be if it be build it should be physicist in comprehensive unify theory of the universe be not simple of opposite of the type of it more to do with the of of the photon of which they in to the of the speed of light which unit velocity the in theory positron be of not when positron electron meet the of their respective photon of which they other in theory the of the universe three dimension of time only one dimension of exist in to our the perihelion point in the orbit of the mercury be observe precisely to the of second of per century second of this to from the other venus jupiter etc the second of be use to help prove einstein theory of but the physicist dewey b result closer to the second by use in one or more of his book he the on the high speed of mercury reject he reject most of include the the speed of light the use of the on doppler shift those with red-shifts move the speed of light most of motion be from u in time in comprehensive unify theory of the universe there three dimension of time of only one but two of those dimension not be from our of the universe the one dimension we be the clock time low speed the of the other two dimension negligible but high speed they become the must be use fudge often use the term time when write this in to it be prove in drop the speed of light but the for be force orthodox physicist ignore the third force in theory force drop force be motion or of motion or between motion include motion the of the universe for be motion inherent in the universe not result of the big which be yet the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b north publisher box oregon index it the portion of unify theory of the universe develop by genius more thirty it solution to most mystery include the of multiple system system the true origin of the cosmic burst the true of white explode etc it look for if they to seriously consider it with open mind the follow be of his theory success in his first book in the structure of the universe predict the existence of explode before find them they consequence of comprehensive theory when be discover he for them burst still their the mysterious burst they be think to from neutron in the disc of our but the new telescope now in orbit be detect them in direction uniformly their source in do not correspond to know object except for few of coincidence burst consequence of the unify theory of the universe develop by the physicist dewey b to of his book the universe of motion publish in the burst come from explosion in the of the universe which the cosmic sector of the between the of the universe the they connect together the burst pop into our in seemingly this be why the source of the burst do not correspond with know object come from direction uniformly i wonder how close to u in source would to be for burst to kill or most life on there would be no to predict one nor to stop it some of the extinction of the which now be on of comet be by burst of the in the in the vicinity of the sun or double but orthodox still no theory how they form or why there so of them but system likely consequence of the comprehensive unify theory of the universe develop by the physicist dewey b i will try to which be in of his book the universe of motion in some of his other book first of to do not energy by fusion come from slow the rest result from the complete of element iron element destructive limit the the element be the lower be this limit it grow in of the product of cosmic the destructive limit of lighter lighter element when the of the the destructive limit of iron there be type i explosion this be there be so much iron present be to the structure of iron the build process which in some of his book better i when the explode the lighter on the outer portion of the be blow in le the speed of light the in the center portion of the bounce close to the speed of light of the high the explosion push over the speed of light it in time which be to in it often for while over long period of time both to the be blow in now to form red the be blow in time to form white both then move the sequence from opposite direction on the h-r the of the two into the in single lone they will form system orbit other to white inverse density be densest it the it center be most widely disperse blow in time this the need to resort to neutron hole etc system if the of the the center of the explode be then of single white there will be mini white revolve the red but still too in time to be by it etc these will become in of the universe of motion use this other principle of his comprehensive unify theory of the universe to derive his own version of bode hole i physicist stephen w recently complete of two hole merge together into single hole conclude the new hole would more the sum of the two hole such result should be by everyone red doubt the whole of hole etc physicist dewey b book his comprehensive unify theory of the universe his book the universe of motion it be to me hole nothing more the object cygnus be just white not the hole orthodox physicist so to prove their theory by the i do not why so much publicity be be give to physicist stephen the physicist seem to be if severe problem somehow him wiser it doe not i wish the be give to physicist dewey b while he still publicity should now be give to theory book the society of unify science propulsion i of concept in connection with ufo unorthodox inventor but i never to find out how or why they work or how they construct i find possible clue why they might work on of the book property of by the physicist dewey b which describe of comprehensive unify theory of the universe i quote one in the precede the development of the theory of the universe of motion different concept of the of the electron we find derive from the environment it bring out in volume i book nothing but motion there process in which produce electron in the motion constitute these electron in by structure the opportunity for this type of motion in such structure limit it follow there be excess of free electron in the sector of the universe most of which in this the electron not move with respect to extension they inherently unit of the of to be not motion in open therefore electron in the with respect to the reference system in the of photon in the context of the reference system the electron like the photon be the speed of light by the progression of the reference system thus expose to flux of electron to the by photon of there other process to be discuss whereby electron return to the environment the electron of such the therefore equilibrium level note in theory electron photon of light of frequency the unit frequency spin one below the unit unit velocity be the speed of light there to the speed of light to theory i might the below mix up be outer be fill with le electron fly the speed of light if this be true then the propulsion field of might be to with these electron or other in give them shoot them the to propulsion in theory be of frequency the unit frequency superimpose on the of the the quote might give clue to confuse meteorologist how why lightning be in cloud suppression of physic the comprehensive unify theory of the universe develop by the physicist dewey b be for more publish in in his first book the structure of the universe it be un-scientific for wheeler the other priest of the religion they science or physic or etc well the scientific the system to ignore theory they theory excellent for thing now orthodox physicist such burst the of theory deserve to be honestly openly discuss in the physic chemistry in the elsewhere the principle of theory should be include in course uw-ec cornell university elsewhere so student not keep in the worthy to the they be feed for more to your question etc consult my cite source book reproduction of this be robert e physic uw-ec
