from ml siemon subject i the why should check let restrict this to why do we to find in the book scripture go on i will on whether dismissive or more open not the kind of issue to with here the question be be the point involve it be quote me often enough by those who do believe i it seriously jesus be to if you love me you will obey my john i like the of christ it be my will i should do he will me to do i or his younger brother but still under his direction though we both god therefore will try to find it be their lord them discover it will feel to do it or to confess their here set the such of christ the point be of religion will the text whether inspire or not hold up model in effort to find to their own this from of sermon the like to the exegesis of scripture the word of god the highest pitch this to question of whether we find in inspire scripture something for our the problem be in find out just it be our lord i go to set for this one direction in which look for these be not i reject but my in this be who deny in of the witness of scripture the question i to with be we find from our lord in scripture turn out to be question if of my inquisitor would like to turn the discussion to the of i them unlike most from scripture b c on roughly in john my quote we john i give you new love one this be the only in the nt where give explicit with the context comment on it mode pronouncement by jesus the so we infer since it be not in john but in the synoptics jesus this this be my body cf luke the mode be greek hence this too be in both we to infer the be direct to wider circle the of disciple we judge the point in mention it with the disciple by then mostly or entirely be we expect to follow this from our lord in the of communion mention this be true of the imply ongoing liturgy in which these word to bind to the to his disciple continue to the community i entirely with this inference but i must point out it be there between u the on which jesus speak the i it inference the very the notion to love one in jesus direct the disciple but i to to the inference the not to me without the from the specific context of it to my own context disciple of christ of scripture to such inference to get sense out of the text this be problem in these text we not them without our own of our in which we the text without some of the context point the when english u i go to presume in follow we the problem of how to scripture under control i do think this be true but it will suffice for my current purpose i will only the issue when we cop with the of old text from world the one we live in question level only introduce more reser the issue will be find we the text the might do the we for see john not merely instruction by jesus to this disciple on one one link it to the synoptic be we criticism from jesus limit our love to those whom we with in we you how it must love your neighbor your enemy but i to you love your enemy in the leviticus context quote doe not your enemy it be merely the common presumption leviticus be to the love should extend to the people of luke in on this q context go on to jesus even sinner love those who love them of this suggest quite strongly i limit the scope of the new be not quite jesus in mind in short inference me to the text to be in force on with object not limit to other trickier the or institution of communion there be the of the commission where the twelve send out to the kingdom of be close the verb be ke russete but the context be specific to the twelve there further specifier in do not turn your step to territory do not enter town the even more specific to jesus journey to which it to see this to the previous prevent from such inference i to to be such inference be not justify in the text nor unlike the first two i cite by the rhetoric of the urge on the still seem to felt oblige to the kingdom of be close even to jesus instruction to the to the gentile to the end of the so him this in the sense of john do i this i do know it be surely but you see how the ripple of inference out from the text be the pretext infer to from be present in the gospel specific i do not object to this kind of but i insist people who it must they some length from we in scripture there involve in this these not themselves though people will do their best to justify their by other reference to scripture which simply more inference into the mix let move on to the we should love god with our whole mind soul this be the synoptic of john yet it be not present in our text the context be controversy with the to cite but when the he silence the they get together to disconcert him one of them put question which be the of the it be by no obvious here though i it such jesus be to be to he be polemic from his enemy in the in more positive light so the scribe in this version more i need to point out this word in the context of forget the for this or luke be he pose the question to disconcert jesus get the good for his luke the context here so confusingly one could be forgive for no inference in no be this if it be obviously to be bind on though i think it entirely conclusion in jesus think it to be so the point be our to grind cycle or so to get to conclusion from of this we to do by jesus of this be contingent on our the point of jesus use of the in the quite different gospel the of such context to u the different context the synoptics curious it should be note only in luke do we get the fix of this by the of the good we look for intent in where give the golden rule the of the the prophet where we echo of hillel the before jesus if we these which i think entirely we indulge in inference the text do not explicitly support u we the text this kind of current theory this my discussion of why the to beyond the community of the disciple beyound the circle of believer here to buttress conclusion this be despite the not so explicitly to few would with my conclusion but i must point out they conclusion they depend on of simply not present in the text themselves the problem keep come up more more severely we look those of jesus not so by we get some divorce be pretty the who divorce his wife be guilty of her cf luke except except in the of this seem to be whether or not we some to this it so but some do in this be it be not if jesus be not explicit this he nothing some of the thing people their teeth over how be it possible if the of christ so with the other of the synoptic i go to continue this into ever-murkier but this be enough to with the theme be find in scripture be exercise in inference our inference inform by our be our own i so identify very few by yet in these some of the difficulty to it be these difficulty i to discus in my next on this topic the divorce strike some of the difficulty i see no evidence the people who so to find to condemn me with spend time write screed to or the horror or viciousness of divorce or u refuse to it or refuse divorcee in their church be not to divorce enter into in it be most definitely of concern in even the most church circle for wildly priest of my in wildly diocese recommend to couple who him to them they ceremony before judge so the public ceremony he need not go through by who would just soon not on this role of interpret the we with this in church effectively by divorce l siemon i you god son of the ml most high of you nevertheless or you die like men ml like prince
