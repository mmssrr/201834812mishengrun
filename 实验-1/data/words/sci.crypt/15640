from subject re off the shelf de re of the chip in smb steven bellovin write in write in smb steven bellovin write ten of do some possible key we do yet know if bite count doe worry me they not go to something they get key be one of the thing be verify fee lot of into the chip then try flip key bite see to the output we know should the output bite should on from key or input if they be out to build cryptosystem it might be the some of the bite much le powerful others in the sense they only enter into the encryption very in the by de design to use key bite possible the output round though i do think be go to crudely they likely to get consider cryptosytem out by xoring bite not use either of these bite except through this xor this system use of every bite but key would now only key to your test by single key bite would turn up interest remember they promise to let committee of outside expert see the cryptosystem design if you something des-like subkey schedule will stick out like sore thumb the i suggest would stick out like sore thumb but i sure i could design system with more subtle key which well-hidden but would still key le encryption i do believe your the be verify
