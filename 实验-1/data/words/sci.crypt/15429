from subject re clipper chip long follow up in jim jim gillogly write this document be in the ftp directory nist look to me like the other shoe drop jim gillogly for post this it this post will be long i will comment on most of it of the in to provide context note group be set up for the clipper stuff note this file will be file from in directory the nist computer security bb the white house office of the press for by the press the president new will bring the government together with industry in hum t vlsi mykotronx wonder to ibm this should be right up their street scheme be mr orwell would love this to improve the security of telephone while meet the need of enforcement telephone encryption behind one like or even de the while true be in the context of circuit such the like the will involve the of new product to the development use of secure network wireless link i would modestly propose use of isdn would do more for commun this lot for too long there be little or no between our sector the enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic the of protect use technology to the sometimes compete interest of economic growth enforcement previous policy pit government industry the right of enforcement encryption technology be use for to protect electronic fund it be now be use to protect electronic computer file while encryption de technology help protect business secret the of it be use by terrorist drug other note the use of the word business in the the whole tenor of this seem to be grind rule only business use be for if you the nothing you drop in your wife to secret be not even on the for note there be no role for you to info in this the only reference be to in the of others the bite be long bow most of these by people who it or often sell the info these people of course in this the people who will the key the use court the white-house pen to go their business when will they be well of them would be better clipper them the protection of the court be seriously erroded over the ofr so microcircuit the clipper chip be develop by government engineer the chip represent new to encryption technology this bite be very true it be use in new inexpensive encryption device be to telephone it telephone use encryption be more powerful in use note the mix of telephone encryption demo of the on pot would be good night i suspect note the not the tone imply this new technology will help protect protect the of phone prevent of the time this technology preserve the of enforcement to intercept the phone of the record seem to be need be tighten of the current i not yet of by the use of secure encryption by the men in the other side by enforcer be well document even by govt the phone v other coms be blur yet key-escrow system will be to ensure the clipper chip be use to protect the of key-escrow system will be to ensure the clipper chip be use to protect the of let run line twice not very it the purpose of the key eschrow be to the use of clipper compulsory note the word ensure to or i will to you so to the person who if it include the of other encryption the in this press be yes device the chip will two unique key number will be need by government to decode encode by the device when the device be the two key will be deposit in two key-escrow will be by the to these key will be limit to government with to conduct just they only now with the clipper chip technology provide enforcement with no new to the content of the of just sure the one preserve to the effectiveness of this new technology the will soon of the new device in respect expert from outside the government will be offer to the of the to it publicly report their find where do you find expert ex kgb people look for post of the stu-iiis they it will be very interest to see if the u to use it it be secure be it the govt will point by it own the chip be step in the problem of encryption sword encryption help to protect the of industry but it shield terrorist we need the clipper chip other both provide with to the encryption they need prevent from use it to hide their in order to technology trend explore new like the key-escrow system the president direct government to develop comprehensive policy on encryption the of our include the need to employ voice or encryption for business purpose use seem to be question the of to telephone under proper court or other order when to protect our so not need it seem the effective timely use of the most modern technology to build the need to promote economic growth the competitiveness of industry in the the need of to export high technology product the seem to slightly impeed this the president direct frequent with industry the congress group the right of policy option develop the be commit to work with the sector to spur the development of which will use new computer technology to give unprecedented to this of high-speed network will video hdtv huge file telephone system voice note this wonderfull stuff will be in secret only the people will be to express opinion hence only the desire result will emerge since encryption technology will role in the government must quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy it use the be commit to policy protect right to while protect them from those who the encryption code be for they in equilibrium with the technology of the time the study of cypher result in swing in of the encrypter the moment i no doubt the problem will in time fofr purpose by the middle of the next century further be provide in sheet the provision of the president directive to the new encryption technology for institute of technology question the clinton q doe this the of government to listen in on phone no clipper chip technology provide enforcement with no new to the content of the of q suppose enforcement be conduct on drug smuggle ring intercept encrypt use the device would they to do to decipher the they would to court order to do the in the first they would then present of this to the two entity responsible for the key the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two which store in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow the two key-escrow will be run by two independent entity this point the of justice the yet to determine which will oversee the key-escrow it be little to critisise q how strong be the security in the device how i be sure how strong the security be this system be more secure other voice encryption system note we drop to if this be true it be it suck big time who drive the crypt work-bench will use it for light before while the will to protect the security of the key escrow system this link between the security of the key-eschrow the be winner give i secret bite number could someone how the of encryption will them we will to invite independent of expert to the to user there no just sure you the cv ok q whose decision it to propose this product the security council the justice the commerce other key be involve in this decision this be endorse by the president the vice president quick with out look be miss from list q who consult the congress industry we on-going discussion with congress industry on encryption issue expect those discussion to intensify we out our review of encryption policy we brief member of congress industry on the decision to this the people who with u who think there be buck in it for them q will the government provide the to the government design develop the key encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product product the microcircuit from the chip produce them the reverse engineer provision of the could be relevent here q who provide the clipper chip mykotronx it their in will sell the chip to encryption device the function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device we expect to consider the clipper chip into their device you do not unless you one of the people q if the be to find solution like the one propose would the be will to use remedy to restrict to more powerful encryption device this be policy question which will be consider during the policy review the key escrow they miss the word secret here he need lesson too will provide with encryption product be more secure more convenient le expensive others but it be just one piece of must be the comprehensive to encryption technology which the be develop i would le secure le more expensive pgp be free le more prone to be comprimised proof to the will be welcome note proof the be not since encryption the public effective enforcement we will prohibit it outright some country effectively do nor be the every of right be entitle to encryption product they do seem to be much sense this doe prohibit it except in very limit this be the one explicit reference to right it be yes i do think the include in clinton et gesture there be tension in the this issue be either-or proposition both concern be in through such be propose with the clipper chip encryption technique the tension be the be between two point the right to be to by put it behind the it be the of the right to ever step you deem to protect your be non hence be define in the govenment to be if you do you must be only do with out note the non question if be here not possible q doe this decision how the clinton policy encryption will differ from of the bush it we the of encryption technology in compute commit to work with industry public-interest group to find to protect help business to compete ensure enforcement the tool they need to fight crime terrorism it we know bush drop the in insert retoric will out this disorderly unruley of freedom sentiment q will the device be will other device use the government voice encryption device subject to export control requirement review for export be require to ensure use of these device the be true for other encryption device one of the of this technology be the protection it give to home with this in mind we expect export license will be on for seek to use these device to secure their own we to review the possibility of permit wider of these product this one be giggle in or they will to the key the do think it the top of my list of thing i must so the restriction will protect me from try to sell me bill of crock for others use it they must be nut good luck folk
