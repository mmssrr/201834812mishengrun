from phil subject the be join it look like dorothy denning get to the even sooner we it time to sure they the other side of the story it loudly phil subject text of white house q on clipper chip encryption note this file will be file from in directory the nist computer security bb the white house office of the press for by the press the president new will bring the government together with industry in to improve the security of telephone while meet the need of enforcement the will involve the of new product to the development use of secure network wireless link for too long there be little or no between our sector the enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic the of protect use technology to the sometimes compete interest of economic growth enforcement previous policy pit government industry the right of enforcement encryption technology be use for to protect electronic fund it be now be use to protect electronic computer file while encryption technology help protect business secret the of it be use by terrorist drug other microcircuit the clipper chip be develop by government engineer the chip represent new to encryption technology it be use in new inexpensive encryption device be to telephone it telephone use encryption be more powerful in use this new technology will help protect protect the of phone prevent of the time this technology preserve the of enforcement to intercept the phone of key-escrow system will be to ensure the clipper chip be use to protect the of device the chip will two unique key number will be need by government to decode encode by the device when the device be the two key will be deposit in two key-escrow will be by the to these key will be limit to government with to conduct the clipper chip technology provide enforcement with no new to the content of the of to the effectiveness of this new technology the will soon of the new device in respect expert from outside the government will be offer to the of the to it publicly report their find the chip be step in the problem of encryption sword encryption help to protect the of industry but it shield terrorist we need the clipper chip other both provide with to the encryption they need prevent from use it to hide their in order to technology trend explore new like the key-escrow system the president direct government to develop comprehensive policy on encryption the of our include the need to employ voice or encryption for business purpose the of to telephone under proper court or other order when to protect our the effective timely use of the most modern technology to build the need to promote economic growth the competitiveness of industry in the the need of to export high technology product the president direct frequent with industry the congress group the right of policy option develop the be commit to work with the sector to spur the development of which will use new computer technology to give unprecedented to this of high-speed network will video hdtv huge file telephone system voice since encryption technology will role in the government must quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy it use the be commit to policy protect right to while protect them from those who the further be provide in sheet the provision of the president directive to the new encryption technology for institute of technology question the clinton q doe this the of government to listen in on phone no clipper chip technology provide enforcement with no new to the content of the of q suppose enforcement be conduct on drug smuggle ring intercept encrypt use the device would they to do to decipher the they would to court order to do the in the first they would then present of this to the two entity responsible for the key the key for the device be use by the drug smuggler the key be split into two which store in order to ensure the security of the key escrow system q who will run the key-escrow the two key-escrow will be run by two independent entity this point the of justice the yet to determine which will oversee the key-escrow q how strong be the security in the device how i be sure how strong the security be this system be more secure other voice encryption system while the will to protect the security of the key escrow system we will to invite independent of expert to the to user there no q whose decision it to propose this product the security council the justice the commerce other key be involve in this decision this be endorse by the president the vice president q who consult the congress industry we on-going discussion with congress industry on encryption issue expect those discussion to intensify we out our review of encryption policy we brief member of congress industry on the decision to this q will the government provide the to the government design develop the key encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product product the microcircuit from the chip produce them q who provide the clipper chip mykotronx it their in will sell the chip to encryption device the function could be license to other vendor in the future q how do i buy one of these encryption device we expect to consider the clipper chip into their device q if the be to find solution like the one propose would the be will to use remedy to restrict to more powerful encryption device this be policy question which will be consider during the policy review the key escrow will provide with encryption product be more secure more convenient le expensive others but it be just one piece of must be the comprehensive to encryption technology which the be develop the be not since encryption the public effective enforcement we will prohibit it outright some country effectively do nor be the every of right be entitle to encryption product there be tension in the this issue be either-or proposition both concern be in through such be propose with the clipper chip encryption technique q doe this decision how the clinton policy encryption will differ from of the bush it we the of encryption technology in compute commit to work with industry public-interest group to find to protect help business to compete ensure enforcement the tool they need to fight crime terrorism q will the device be will other device use the government voice encryption device subject to export control requirement review for export be require to ensure use of these device the be true for other encryption device one of the of this technology be the protection it give to home with this in mind we expect export license will be on for seek to use these device to secure their own we to review the possibility of permit wider of these product
