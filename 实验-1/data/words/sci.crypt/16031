from s subject re clipper consider in smb steven bellovin write there three issue with clipper the first be whether or not the of the whole scheme be of work my with one exception be yes i do think nist design this scheme well be their objective to permit under with minimum risk of the exception be u exist outside of the chip on diskette seriously wrong should be onto the chip to those who i do my be obvious though i find my own sufficiently i force to rewrite the conclusion section of my i the scheme i issue this you be with implement such system with complete for civil right due process would you do differently in this question both strong outsider the to some domestic user be if you feel it to those do it in the context of the issue i present below right here i discuss just the no i do by just something be do it should be ok steve here sketch of i believe most of the objection to the clipper scheme exclusive or e m k m encrypt by key k d m k m decrypt by key k h m of m x chip unit key from escrow x x remote chip unit key from escrow x n number of the chip n number of the remote chip number of escrow k k session key upon to this protocol f key need not be secret protocol choose such k remote chip doe for k compute the follow e e l n e n f remote chip doe the for l send l to remote chip receive l from remote chip compute ke h k n k d l f kd h k d l f k n note d l f n remote chip doe the for ke kd user be encrypt decrypt with key ke ke kd kd no door in e d h h be not invertible for e d h secret otherwise bogus chip could with chip the chip only support the follow return n x return e x x return e n f give e n f return n k give e n f compute ke kd give m return e m ke give m return d m kd into the chip be determine by destroy the chip u u f n u u not be determine except by destroy the chip this not be true in i suppose it possible to determine how chip be with sp to look for blow fuse the u by the escrow note for escrow y be give n e y y n e y y return y y must escrow with the number from both chip the encrypt key this the to record both chip be only get the session key not the key to of chip this preclude decrypt of but be one of the requirement in order for secure by scheme to work the need to secret if this secret be by those know the secret be obvious the the key complexity suggest the key be from silicon of the scheme lot the rsbx s
