from crypt-comments subject for this be the eighth of ten of the the mostly independent but you should the first before the rest we do the time to send out miss by so do note such refer to the reference list in the the section of this ftp to xx the be post to the newsgroups every content how do i recover from lose in wordperfect how do i vigenere cipher how do i send encrypt under unix pgp ripem pem be the unix crypt secure how do i use compression with encryption be there cipher doe in be the unicity point unicity be key why be it i use or number key be the correct frequency list for english letter be the how do i shuffle i foil by encrypt my cd-rom you do of simple cipher be the cod system use by vcr how do i recover from lose in wordperfect wordperfect encryption be show to be very to the method us xor with two key type byte-wide counter to the length full description give in bennett bergen chris write someone look for to decrypt wordperfect document file i think i solution there be south orem ut will decrypt wordperfect lotus m excel file the cost of the be steep price but if you think your pw key be le or give them for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt file or le pw key how do i vigenere cipher cipher where the ciphertext be something like the xor keykeykeykey so on be vigenere cipher if the key be not too long the be in english do the follow discover the length of the key by count coincidence see sinkov try of the ciphertext itself count those byte which if the two ciphertext portion use the key something over of the byte will be if they use different key then le will be byte of key cover text the which key be the length of the key shift the text by length xor it with itself this remove the key you with text xored with itself since english bite of per byte of text xored together bite of info per byte provide plenty of for choose unique decryption in one of text xored with itself just bite per byte if the key be short it might be even to this substitution the old text show how to those it possible with those method in the of expert if there only ten time much text key see for sinkov how do i send encrypt under unix pgp ripem pem here one method use the de file compress de uuencode there be de jure internet in the work pem it be describe in rfcs through to join the pem list pem-dev-request there be version of pem be test the time of this write there two in the public for encrypt pgp ripem both by ftp it own newsgroup it own well pgp be most commonly use outside the since it us the without license be only or in the ripem be most commonly use inside the since it us the which be freely within the but not for shipment outside the since both use secret key for encrypt the body of the pgp use ripem us de for encrypt the key they should be to freely there be for to the other choice no be this time we know be the unix crypt secure no see there be cbw crypt workbench which be use to do ciphertext-only on file encrypt with crypt one source for cbw be ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption number of people propose do perfect compression follow by some simple encryption method xor with key you only compress perfectly if you know the distribution of possible input for purpose it impossible to describe the english text beyond such single-letter frequency you build up more more model of your input but if the enemy slightly more model he be to find some in your compress output note compression scheme unless they be design with in mind produce output off with high for the output of unix compress begin with well-known three-byte number serve enter wedge for this be not to compression before encryption be inherently it just to be do very very by no remove the need for strong encryption compression encryption be silly be there cipher yes the one-time be see the one-time require secure distribution of much key of course cryptosystem need not be utterly to be useful it need to be strong enough to resist by likely enemy for length of time the it protect be expect to doe in much more out of number most for source of bite to be it must be impossible to predict the nth bite will be give complete knowledge of the or the the sequence of through bite for n up to the lifetime of the source know the function of truly seed to longer string of bite this seed must be enough not to be guess by the opponent it should be truly by number source those who could for number use the input device source of entropy by not connect to it for compress foo give file of high entropy not but with much in it one then encrypt file use of itself key for to convert seed entropy into string when look for device to provide this entropy it be to the entropy just it look to it must be for disk completion time sound like they might be to people but spin disk be much like clock it output completion time low in entropy be the unicity point unicity see the unicity be to of ciphertext such the sum of the entropy in the correspond source text encryption key the number of ciphertext bite use ciphertexts longer this be show to unique decipherment this be use to up of the of ciphertext-only ciphertexts shorter this likely to multiple decryption therefore to security from the opponent difficulty choose the correct one unicity like or doe not deterministic prediction but give result the minimum of ciphertext for which it be likely there be only single intelligible correspond to the ciphertext when possible key try for the decryption work cryptologist do with unicity such they directly determine the likelihood of event of interest let the unicity of cipher be d if fewer d ciphertext be intercept then there be not enough to distinguish the key from set of possible key de unicity of which be le ciphertext block block correspond to this seem low first but the unicity give no of the work require to find the key d be intercept in seldom proceed the line use in discuss unicity like other such key unicity be something insecurity if it too but doe security if it high few cryptosystems impervious to of might serve enter wedge to some cipher however useful for to determine recommend key for cryptosystem employ of test to help guide the in the most promise direction most on the of to even the work of turing see for some insight into the possibility see be key why be it one of the of be the enemy be in full possession of the of the system only the specific key employ in the encryption of course one would the doe not of tell it cryptosystems but find out use of finite of key provide progress thus in modern system where of both must not only sound cryptosystem but enough key to cover the key refer to the distribution of key publicly of modern key technology be the stu iii secure telephone unit which for use employ cod crypto ignition key key center by there be in ciks use by control personnel to the of key to perform function such the report of lose ciks this should give inkling of the extent of the key problem for public-key system there issue to do with whom do you trust i use or number key produce from the simplest be sequence one of the most type of number where there be no obvious dependence between seed output the of such sequence will in high enough dimension show up this correspond to structure which be notoriously for to exploit more more structure which be why they interest picture but strong sequence will no structure see exercise be the correct frequency list for english letter there three to this question slightly deeper the one before you find the first in book frequency list compute directly from of english text of course such list will be correctly compute but which list you get depend on which the second be the question doe sense do you by english letter the english be not fix finite close object be it over time it be different between different will different from those of the whole the third be yes no be go to the english in but for us these slight wo in there entire field other entropy method likelihood which study question like the text with these letter frequency be in english come up with robust so your own list from your own of english text it will be good enough for work if you use it properly be the for project in security we look for source of the code how it break by the british during wwii see how do i shuffle shuffle be of the of of use or function possible output of this process should be likely to do this you need function x which will produce uniformly distribute integer in the give function you shuffle with the follow c code be the length of the two give for n n n n x not be with simple x since not be divisible by x in most the error will be very to cover this one modulus mod x number y if return le y go get i foil by encrypt my cd-rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish cd-rom with possibly multiple piece of with encrypt will to use different key for user even good for only limit period of time in order to we know this be impossible since there be nothing in pc or which uniquely identify the user the if there be such then the cd-rom could be encrypt with key in on the one sell to the user in on the unique identifier however in this the cd-rom be one of kind the intend purpose if the cd-rom be to be encrypt once then produce there must be key or set of key for encryption produce some in the process key be with copy of the cd-rom the need only to key sell it with the copy you do of simple cipher schneier bruce schneier of orem sell
