from greg onufer subject re let build cryptophones for over the internet in write in finney write i try this code on my elc it over second to compress second worth of speech this it need to be by over of before it will be in even mode ouch for try it the follow be very quick i few month to determine whether sun ipc could perform full-duplex encrypt with result by modem this test from the device compress it with gsm compress of record into bite result in encrypt it with de then revers the process send the reconstruct to the device the compress encrypt be my ipc not very these slower elc would just this underruns would occcur but the speech very intelligible i it process to get the best result remember though this be quick the be improve the compression routine be ftp from i believe look for gsm or i use eric young de but i no longer know where i get it from cheer greg cut here test to see how much cpu it for secure write by g onufer greg write on sun ipc run with sun isdn s-bus include include include include include include include include include int fd info if null if ioctl fd perror return info if ioctl fd info perror return if ioctl fd flushrw perror return info if ioctl fd info perror return return int ifd gsm buf if ifd fprintf stderr short return buf return int ofd gsm buf if buf fprintf stderr return if write ofd fprintf stderr short return return gsm int int option key open if perror open exit gsm compression code if null fprintf stderr svs exit option if option fprintf stderr svs exit de code key if key fprintf stderr svs exit if key fprintf stderr svs exit memset memset open device configure it if null exit for get convert to byte if exit block long long memmove if if memcmp fprintf stderr svs memcmp exit endif byte convert to if exit cut here
