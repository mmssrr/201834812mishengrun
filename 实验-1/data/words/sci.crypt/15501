from subject spoof clipper number secrecy in clipper chip the number of the clipper chip be encrypt with the system key one of three the protocol be recover if by nothing else if you will chip or logic sit between the clipper chip it the purpose of this chip be twofold the spoof chip xors the bite encrypt number with key this render the number with just the system key recieve the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypt number with key the number be for this the net result of hide the number this get more interest when the number of number issue become it difficult to distinguish between number spoof number without know the system key you could lie the number but risk detection of the lie if you the system key the encryption you could successfully lie with lower of detection by the of your own number you wonder be hide here seem like the secrecy be to prevent you from lie who you
