from pom prof dr pommerening subject de init vector key the risk of get lose in the clipper chip discussion i give on my recent question in pqscbcnh i write the recent discussion in this news group suggest key de be quite now but de be in cbc or cfb mode where one choose init vector of byte question it sense to the init vector key then we bite key if yes be know the security of this key scheme we it by through the bite key the be no the vector doe give security i get from smb open my eye it pretty simple e be encryption d decryption with key k on block let c be the vector m m the block c c the cipher text block then encryption in cipher block cbc mode work by the c i e m i xor c decryption by m i c xor d c i so if the doe c this only the first block m but she do her key on m m the in cipher cfb mode be bite more but leave exercise for the there be the modify output mode ofb where de or block cipher you use simply by s i e s with vector seed s encryption be give by c i m i xor s i here the know cipher reduce the to key for k pommerening institut fuer und der obere
