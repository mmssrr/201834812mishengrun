from bontchev vesselin bontchev subject re text of white house q on clipper chip encryption clipper clipper chip write the president new will bring the government together with industry in to improve the security of telephone while meet the need of enforcement nice for the introduction of the first encryption device with built-in just like the feed for too long there be little or no between our sector the enforcement community to resolve the tension between economic the of protect use technology to the sometimes compete interest of economic growth enforcement previous policy pit government industry the right of enforcement protect electronic computer file while encryption technology help protect business secret the of it be use by terrorist drug other indeed the current doe nothing to prevent the telephone it telephone use encryption be more powerful in use this doe much there incredibly encryption in use this new technology will help protect protect the of phone prevent of except from the government the time this technology preserve the of enforcement to intercept the phone of nope the wo be stupid enough to use the new chip they use something secure this technology provide only to intercept the phone of people who stupid enough to use it to decode encode by the device when the device be the two key will be deposit in two key-escrow will be by the to these key will be limit to government with to conduct be the government the key it doe much if they in one or in two of it the clipper chip technology provide enforcement with no new to the content of the of correct it doe however provide those with the sense of device in respect expert from outside the government will be offer to the of the to it publicly report their find if the screen be not public it not be trust some people do not trust de even the only some of it design be keep secret the chip be step in the problem of encryption sword encryption help to protect the of industry but it shield terrorist we need the clipper chip other both provide with to the encryption they need prevent from use it to hide their in order to technology so they use different technology to hide their so will those who do not trust their government not to misuse it to decrypt their the of our include the need to employ voice or encryption for business purpose except from the government the need of to export high technology product huh it the new technology will be export restrict since encryption technology will role in the government must quickly to develop consistent comprehensive policy it use the be commit to policy protect right to while protect them from those who the in short the new technology protect the from the snooper it not protect him from the government if it decide to misuse it to decrypt the protect him from the who succeed to the new encryption scheme or to the key or to bribe the people who them etc prevent the from use secure encryption for q doe this the of government to listen in on phone no clipper chip technology provide enforcement with no new to the content of the of correct however it doe not provide them much it q who will run the key-escrow the two key-escrow will be run by two independent entity this point the of justice the yet to determine which will oversee the key-escrow two the the q how strong be the security in the device how i be sure how strong the security be this system be more secure other voice encryption system be trust u while the will to protect the security of the key escrow security through obscurity system we will to invite independent of expert to the to user there no if it not entirely open to public it not be trust besides who prove the device use for the one build into your phone will be the q whose decision it to propose this product the security council the justice the the the fbi q who consult the congress industry we on-going discussion with congress industry on encryption issue expect those discussion to intensify we out our review of encryption policy we brief member of congress industry on the decision to this why do they forget the q will the government provide the to the government design develop the key encryption microcircuit but it be not provide the microcircuit to product product the microcircuit from the chip produce them doe this smell to monopolism q who provide the clipper chip mykotronx it their in will sell the chip to encryption device the function could be license to other vendor in the future like the q if the be to find solution like the one propose would the be will to use remedy to restrict to more powerful encryption device this be the question why it bury the end this be policy question which will be consider during the policy review the key escrow we see will provide with encryption product be more secure more convenient le expensive others but it be just one trust u the be not since encryption the public effective enforcement we will prohibit it outright some country in short if we decide to strong crypto we tell you effectively do nor be the every of right be entitle to encryption product there be since the u government seem to consider strong crypto munition since the u constitution the right to every to why be not every entitle of right to encryption product it we the of encryption technology in compute commit to work with industry public-interest group to find to protect help business to compete ensure enforcement the tool they need to fight crime terrorism bullshit the propose technology provide sense of security encryption device with built-in for the encryption doe not prevent the to use strong crypto be step to strong crypto q will the device be will other device use the government voice encryption device subject to export control requirement review for export be require to ensure use of these device the who the optimist who believe the new will the export control on strong crypto device ok i not it not my business but i just could resist to comment the whole plot look so it up to you to fight for your right vesselin now be the time for sternlight to pop up the new system be vesselin bontchev virus test
