from smythw smythe subject re how to detect use of cipher in betel robert write fenton fenton write how the government tell which encryption method one be use without be to decode the in order to me of use strong encryption technique they would to both key out of escrow run them my ciphertext i think this it quite possible the system in the number of the device be use they get the number use the for the first to get the key if they someone who use encryption but do find prefix then they it encryption scheme from the limit so it seem the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key otherwise the key problem inherent to symetric cipher would the system it some sort of public key the of how they would identify the key in their this either the develop some non public key or the feed decide to pkp the former be excite posibility since keep the secret while chip widely will be if the feed force to it in order to public could on public key crypto in the for my impression of the whole scheme it seem of try to strong crypto they try to co-opt it their contention they need to keep the secret to protect the security of the key suggest possible inherent to the more likely be they dont construct device which dont the key register else notice in their q session they the key only to people with proper but the key will simply to be they seem to be try to keep open the posibility of key without court order even though phone line require one pick up on their implicit of eithe this or we strong crypto outright i dont trust this to oppose it in possible bill smythe
