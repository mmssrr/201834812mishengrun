the notion of product cipher be due to of modern product cipher include lucifer de sp-networks loki pe khufu the feistel cipher of product cipher which on one of the ciphertext round then the ciphertext round lucifer de loki of feistel cipher the follow the of product cipher cipher block length key bite number of round lucifer de loki x pe product cipher secure nobody know how to prove product cipher be completely secure so in one begin by the cipher look highly for the cipher must be it must produce ciphertext which depend on every bite of the the key meyer show round of de require to such dependence in this sense product cipher should mix function which combine the key ciphertext in complex the fix per-round substitution of the product cipher refer to s-boxes for lucifer s-boxes de s-boxes the of product cipher reduce to design of these s-boxes list of design for the s-boxes of de which to s-boxes in be find in brown brickell et some group-theoretic property of product cipher let e be product cipher n-bit block to n-bit block let x be the encryption of x under key k then for fix k the send x to x be of the set of n-bit block denote this by the set of n-bit be the symmetric group be write s the collection of these where k over possible key be denote e s if e be from to ciphertexts then we would expect e s to subset of s coppersmith show very simple product cipher the group give sufficient number of round the group be of the symmetric group it consist of even which be write even number of even goldreich be to extend these result to show feistel cipher give sufficient number of round the security of multiple encipherment depend on the group-theoretic property of cipher multiple encipherment be extension over single encipherment if for key there doe not exist third key such x e x which encrypt twice with two independent key be to single encryption under the third key if for every there exist such eq be true then we e be group this question of whether de be group under this definition extensively study by rivest in their they give strong evidence for the hypothesis de be not group in de be not group be prove the security of product cipher from be produce by e under some key k the of the designer of e be to ensure to be element of s the symmetric group let r be element of s select we will r if observer give r in some order not distinguish between these two in time be with time bound resource the observer not determine which of the be produce by e the decision be no better simply guess luby show of feistel cipher
