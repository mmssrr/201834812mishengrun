from subject report on off-line i recently publish new off-line electronic system report cwi be phd-student our group long history in in the field of system the report be be retrieve from from the directory the postscript-file be for from we present new off-line electronic system on problem the problem of which little use be in thus our system be the first to be entirely on discrete use the problem concept some technique introduce u to construct protocol for do not use the cut choose methodology of system consequence our system be much more efficient in both complexity such system propose previously of our system concern it to previously propose system it correctness be prove to very extent if we one concern single the to the system seem to imply one the problem our system offer number of extension to in previously know system in our opinion the most interest of these be the entire system include the extension be in set on with observer which the double-spending be prevent in the first detect the identity of double-spender the in it be even under the most stringent requirement the of the user which seem to be impossible to do with previously propose system benefit of our system be by negligible of success independent of compute power by simple from within the system which be something previous solution entirely furthermore the system be extend to check multi-show divisibility while it efficiency to try to this system i effort to keep the report possible nevertheless if you question to me i will try to reply good i comment welcome cwi sj the tel
