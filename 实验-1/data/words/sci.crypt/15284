from smb steven bellovin subject clipper some new think i prefer it if we do the go on infinitum time true for for i since the be in different group right now i go to focus here on some of the hence my followup to if you not your feel turn on some of these issue for with key simply split it into two piece be much le other scheme it if just one repository be we overly would-be would need to recover just more bite of key i need not point out in this newsgroup pretty to do by slightly more complex scheme xor-ing the key with number then with it complement would produce two subkeys neither of which be useful be much more to one get even more to protect the subkeys even more other think some people note the complexity of the but the id string the phone emit could be their door key double-encrypted with the escrow repository public key for they could do only with session key no door in the fbi would to bring every intercept to the repository to be decrypt this would of the objection the line of how do you sure they stop we even combine with of the telephony door the switch do the but with record of the time phone number etc of the provide proof to the escrow the do in with the term of the i suggest other too suppose clipper chip public key would be use time which you need more key not in event this could be use to enforce time limit or limit on the key the repository would deliver would for very long i suspect the itself be secure from the obvious why push when you get the door i think the government be still genuinely concern foreign this scheme let the spook their it too i rumor over the some within be with de it too good not they could it but it much too expensive to do so they they keep the secret so others do build their own without the door the protocol though be i see no for keep it secret i hope i show there lot of to do thing quite
