from jon c r bennett subject on clipper i to why the encryption need to be keep secret some thing i think it imply of course these could be wrong from the clipper chip dorothy denning revise the clipper chip single-key block encryption the us bite key with for the de round of with for the de it support de mode of the clock tick in electronic codebook ecb mode run mbit per second chip include the follow component the encryption f key be common to chip n number this length be subject to u secret key unlock encrypt with the chip encrypt with the chip to see how the chip be use it be embed in the t telephone security device it will be suppose i someone we both such device push button to secure my security device will session key k with the device the other end this key without the clipper chip in method of key be use such the public-key distribution method once the session key k be the clipper chip be use to encrypt the or m voice the telephone security device fee k m into the chip to produce two e m k the encrypt e e k u n f enforcement field which over the telephone line the enforcement field thus the session key k encrypt under the unit key u with the number n encrypt under the key f the enforcement field be decrypt by enforcement be suppose i know how the work know the n for my chip but do not know f then by i might be to determine f from if enforcement field e e k u n f not know n would might this much now suppose i know f either or not if i know k either i involve in the or i know u for in the i now be to determine u for the other if i know f i the enforcement field since i could my own with different k then the one i use know f to be perform so i might not know you but i could know who you it too now i someone try to compute u will not lot of to work from but since we no of know the key method doe not key or for the publish method be in use the u will be choose from know key for the system obviously the compromise of f would be both to enforcement for whom this whole thing be design for the people who believe it be give them security f be but one number i sure of people more then know it be if some of expert be go to check it over for then more will know f forget grind chip bribery work just fine so i wrong or these problem jon
