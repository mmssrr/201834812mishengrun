from mrr subject list of integer this be the file from in response to request i this list of of which i most of these c function in source form for your convenience i copy of some of these on they for ftp in the directory however i not be the most current version in here they in no order mp multiple precision come with some unix multiple precision lmp on your compiler provide gcd sqrt come with sunos next bbn few others see mp object code only of course henri cohen et universite i multiple precision desk routine code for code for slow generic c version doe both integer doe vector well number of function some of which i never of weber function function test other stuff plenty of tex public but you distribute modify version ftp from there seem to be next-specific version there in to in field kevin r coombes r of routine for precision integer or over finite field include few others like gcd source code in c distribute under the term of the gnu public license include tex precision lloyd los c which support provide for point non-integers not polish the others here post to in october bignum j vuillemin others distribute by equipment decprl efficient integer c code with generic c kernel plus kernel for intel mips of course this be one of the better-known of this type implement mod plus or xor both sign unsigned from you will receive shell give your you will receive print from include tex publicly for use i remove this from my when i rumor prl doe like others to distribute it however bignum be distribute of ecpp see below bellcore unsigned integer write entirely in c include mod test sqrt number few others the uncommented undocumented i try to enough comment to get by this be the only of these i use it work well be very i do the others but the code look clever be number theorist unlike the other here this one require you to only problem if your number huge the code in the public bellcore improve version of this one doe sign which be turn off option few new routine too minor bugfixes to the bmp brent multiple precision r p brent code to do extend precision fix point include most of the function you find in run-time this code be number to send to netlib the line send from bmp or better yet just with help spx joseph dec this be huge prototype public key system on i mention it here those who of spx correctly guess it integer i to inform you the integer it be indeed dec bignum from you get test copy of spx from use it only for test it expire on i do know whether this expire yet multiple precision louko multiple precision integer in c include pow mod mod y sqrt gcd for use the include public key system on the this be of the well-known but i remove the de to to with export the result gennum per bothner u of c routine to do generic both integer formerly on however it seem to sorry by someone in dublin integer multiple precision include test encryption not public it be from the code work see in byte or dr dobbs precision multiple precision integer in c with sqrt mod pow log simple vector support doe of memory free long you do sell it or us it prof yuji rikkyo university nishi-ikebukuro tokyo multiple-precision version of the for ms-dos include point by keith briggs to be pretty object only i think ervin this be the best i know of for version for include routine to do mpqs the currently know file be both site to mpqs to use drive so it up to digit number function include in it over digit of precision ftp from or or unknown ms-dos c-like infinite precision nice intrinsic function ervin report problem when precision on the fly see or keith briggs kbriggs turbo source for routine do multiple-precision sqrt gcd for integer include for number institute fur experimentelle dr schneider c multiple-precision subroutine i do know it to for more info institute fur experimentelle ellernstr longint mueller mueller multi precision write in with the most time write in include well modulo number module provide collection of procedure for test gcd inverse more the be of pem which include pem key tool source be in c for sun longint be port to ms-dos under logitech turbo free for university use otherwise source license be require to write or to mueller dietikon mueller bignum write in c will in the future conform to the common lisp function integer currently include exptmod number gcd gnu multiple precision gnu free multiple precision i look it yet this be current of but there be more recent version by the time you this this be very widely on ftp site elliptic curve prove to prove the of prime include bignum from pgp pretty good philip crypto include bignum routine in c to be quite for intel processor unix version the crypto but the bignum routine be use without of repercussion bell precision i bell dbell with good online help c-like builtin function support for integer number they work like point complex number string list file object include gcd test even trig function recommend though from built-in support in other multiple precision be in number of such lisp cf perl by from include source in perl for such but it not for serious use for some of these source code be this list be long enough so i not go to pursue it to ed vielmetti others who contribute to this list mrr
