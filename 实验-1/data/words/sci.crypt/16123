from russell subject from crossbow to begin pgp sign note the follow speech by chuck in letter to his give the end of this document russell from crossbow to the technology give the future of freedom conference november you know technology computer technology often get in cir cles we tend to think of orwell or terry or the proximity detector keep berlin on their own side of the border or the so bug device nixon use to those on his enemy list or we for the price of ticket on the concorde we fly twice the speed of sound but only if we first thru run by government permit him to thru our be long if it beep but i think mind-set be before there be prod government torture their prisoner with club rubber hose before there be for government use though government us technology to oppress the evil lie not in the tool but in the wielder of the tool in technology represent one of the most promis ing for our freedom from those who steal them by it very it the bright who put it to use over the dull who not it the who quick to see the merit of the new over the sluggish who cling to time test two better word there to de scribe government dull sluggish one of the triumph of technology over i see be the invention of the crossbow with it could now out to fifty meter even if be mount knight unlike the longbow which more powerful could get off more shoot per unit time the crossbow require no to the longbow require kinesthetic to degree of the wielder of crossbow could simply put the to his shoulder sight the itself be of hit his get moreover since just the only mount knight likely to visit your would be government soldier collector the utility of the device with it the common could defend themselves not only one but their it the of the pierce bullet consequently king priest the of of crossbow respec tively for it possession look development we see how technology like the the rifle the follow by the gun more gun the of inter-group power not without the colt the host with one in her possession now fully to protect herself the roughneck in ments for the period reflect the of the rifle by on with one of these rifle simply not be long his be rely upon flintlock or single-shot rifle the quote be doubtless true one now to the present the public-key cipher with computer to run it represent equiv in defensive not only such technique be use to protect sensitive in one own possession but it permit two to ex over insecure phone line for or skywriting for without ever previously meet to cipher key with com puter you cipher x-mp in within few it should be to encrypt voice communi soon full-color video technology will not only obsolete it will demolish government control over in i like to just moment to sketch the ic which this principle possible this be the rivest who jointly it it security derive from the if very number be the product of two very prime then it be extremely difficult to the two prime from of their product ex tremely in the sense if prime p q digit then their product not in gen be in le by the most powerful computer now in existence the public of the key consist of the prod uct pq of the two prime p q one tor it x of the product xy where xy the of the key consist of the other y block of the text to be encrypt be first turn into integer either by use or even simple this integer be then to the power x modulo pq the result integer be then send the encrypt the receiver decrypt by this integer to the secret power y modulo pq it be show this process will yield the number with this development why it be public-key be i openly publish the product pq the number x while keep secret the number y so send me encrypt x mod pq but only i recover the by they send it to the power y the result mod pq the risky step meet to cipher key be so people who not even trust other enough to to meet still ex encrypt select his own pq his x while the secrecy of his own y benefit of this scheme be the notion of dig to one to the source of give if i to send you i my to your x the result mod your pq send however if in my i the it to my secret power y the result mod my pq then result to your x mod your pq send this then even you decrypt the it will still look like however if you then it to my public power x the result mod my public pq so you will not only recover the ori but you will know no one but i could send it to you since no one else know my secret y these the very concern by the to torment the soviet union the whole question of computer on the one they schoolchildren right now grow up with com puters sliderules use to be more so in there thing computer do which will interest instruct it be pre cisely these student who one hence will be go their soviet for the soviet to hold might be continue to while your on the other else computer be it be exquisitely efficient copy floppy disk will hold of word of text be copy in couple of minute if this be enough the computer perform the copy encrypt the in be but remember in soviet society publicly cessible xerox unknown the few copy in existence control more inten sively gun in the unite now the position be we should not sell these computer to the soviet they could use them in system the position be we should sell them in the interest of if we do the there will be some other will to for my i to suggest the position should be to give them to the soviet for free if them them if doe work up drop them over moscow in the middle of the night for by sub scription of course not i confess this be not position much support member of the left-right spectrum but ter in the word of one of we the shortest to not look like most people would consider line long enough world-view it be the soviet govern ment monopoly on could better to the enfeeblement indeed to the dissolution of the soviet empire would the production of missile moscow but there the rub long enough world view doe suggest the evil the oppressive the coercive the simply stupid will get they deserve but not be how the rest of u be kill or in the process when the other collectivist to freedom they possess function economy unlimited time to proceed to it policy of but now we economy hold together by wire spit the not only u to fee the poor while induce to milk cow drive up food price it then turn sub into design to in yield of milk from the cow leave or witness the decline in the price of oil be consider frighten few when the price go up we be tell the economy risk for for of energy the price the of the feed swing into for the first time in history the speed which you drive your to work in the morning be issue of concern now when the price of oil drop we risk problem this time oil third world who sell oil not be to ever their debt to our grossly over-extended the suggest be government should now the oil price opec lower new oil since the government be seek to oil price to the extent opec do we this except the of civil the government it own people in you ine entity in the world except government go to court vendor sell it good too not only vendor be compel by the court to it price but it be punish for the of lower them in the first so while the could to couple of hundred to our economy our liberty we not count on period of in which to them i contend there exist hole effect in the evolution of just in the evolution of once free dom beyond minimum extent the the of the continuum itself to the degree subsequent re-emergence of freedom become but impossible good of this be see in the of when those who sup the public trough outnumber thus outvote those whose must replenish the trough then possible choice but to the ing from the few for the benefit of the go down to the office find just two people on the dole between them they form vote bloc forever outvote you on the question of who own your life the fruit of your life so those who love liberty need edge of some sort if we go to we obvi ously use the other-directedness of work suffer so next of billion live in better world however such might be it be nonetheless extremely powerful one in culture if you convince people to work for only enough for their so to enough enough to continue work then you truly reservoir of energy to from this be just the sort of which not be for egoistic or if i be to up before you tonight something like listen follow me i my noble contribute your money to support the give up your free time to work for the strive selflessly to bring it then you your child your child child will live under egoism you think i go of course you be right the point i try to be egoism will be if when egoist find it to do so only then while i do not the concept of poli i do believe it be the only nor even the most cost-effective freedom in our time consider for of the investment in time money effort i might expend in try ing to convince the to form of censorship i every who in terested how to use to them there be proverb to the eskimoes which very likely most while you likely would not with the you might well feel you it often enough it nothing further to u moreover you even tire of it i therefore it now if you give fish the run you fee him for but if you how to fish you fee him for lifetime your exposure to the quote in some sort of v context if you genuinely wish to help someone in need you should him how to his not simply how to beg for it of course this be true if only the next time he be hungry there might not be will or even to give him fish with the on how to fish he be completely self sufficient but i submit this only the first order content of the quote if there be nothing further to from it i would your time by cite it it seem to though to imply we should structure our tivities so to the benefit to such hungry we encounter but consider suppose this eskimo doe know how to fish but he doe know how to hunt you on the other often go hungry while thru country you no how to the thing they most of the fish you could now suppose the two of you decide to fish knowledge for hunt knowledge well the first thing to observe be of this type refute the premise every must winner loser the if one person it must be the expense of person who lose under this such be not the some thing he do not before neither be dimin ished in when it come to of object life be no longer this be extremely powerful notion the of diminish return the first second of those which our possi bilities in other context no longer bind u now or consider possibility suppose this hungry eskimo never to fish the ruler of his decree fish fish tiny bone sometimes spine he tell u the decree their consumption even their possession too to the people to be permit even by will it be body think to be government property therefore it be the function of the to punish those who improperly for govern ment property or it be the gener ously extend to competent the benefit it provide to child to the ill full-time supervisory so they need not trouble themselves with choice think risky or but in you stupefy while your eskimo re how this be so seriously friend of his recently imprison for for the crime of po session of nine ounce of trout with intent to distribute now you conclude society so grotesquely oppressive to enforce of this type be simply to the dignity of be you go ther decide to commit some portion of your discretion time to the of this your be in the sense of to the oppress or egoistic in the sense of prove you the oppressor or very likely some of these or per even other motif but since you desire to become to your you not to mount or even try to run of fish through the however it be here technology in in technology multiply your hundredfold i for of the effort none of the risk to smuggle in hundred fish you quite produce hundred xerox copy of fish instruction if the get government like permit open discussion of topic whose be re stricted then should suffice but if the government to suppress the flow of well then you will to little more effort write your fish on floppy disk encrypt to your eskimo public-key but to fish you genuine which continue to others the you provide you not to of your time try to convert id or even try to win over the unde cided browne dictum from freedom in unfree world the success of be in inversely to the number of people whose sion be to it fulfilment if you look history you not deny it be by men with like lincoln nixon their ilk but it be by people with like edison curie this be per not so bloody where i try to the libertech project beseech the to not en plunder or u i propose net work the technology by which we freedom for ourselves but here we must be bite while it be not present to encrypt when government to spy on you there be no of the fu ture hold there be bill introduce for ple which would it crime to body when government to shoot you be if you be to commit crime while vest then would constitute crime of it own this to my knowledge not yet but it doe how government think other however do indeed pose risk we for who help pre-civil on the underground use of technology the sovereign government of the unite of time find the buy sell of be quite the buy sell of simi during prohibition who use his to ferment into the drug the control wine use technol ogy in could get him shoot by for his crime not to be restore to life when congress reverse itself re-permitted use of this drug so to quote former president un-indicted co felon let me one thing perfectly the libertech project doe not in or conspire in the of no how oppressive or simply stupid such be it doe in description for purpose only of process some of these process like fly or well require li cense to perform no license be need for the distribution or receipt of it self so the next time you look the scene think well if of the of this of this city to turn before i be free then somebody might well cut my now put me out of my misery such be not the there exist to your self free if you wish to explore such technique the project you welcome to give me your or drop for you go on the list for my newsletter friend or whom you think would be interest welcome well i not even for self envelope since my printer bel cost down in the noise with the other effort in get issue out if you should to or even useful product to plug i be to you write it up for even if you to be the free rider just benefit from others contribute you still welcome everything will be public feel free to copy it or give it or sell it for if you get money for it while i try to give it you entitle to your profit every of these principle should the world just little freer i will to underwrite for the fu ture i will you with one think if you do how to your into sword before they sword then you sure hell ought to before they too chuck the libertech project queensbury drive los the libertech december with the permission of chuck by russell those interest in the issue in this piece should in these newsgroups copy of the public key encryption pgp
