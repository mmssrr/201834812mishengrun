from subject re new encryption from denning the clipper chip dorothy denning revise the chip by mykotronx inc which them the the silicon be supply by vlsi technology inc clipper chip inside scif secure which be the scif computer equipment to the chip chip during single session the scif be mykotronx distribution notice this be on provide by nist fbi mykotronx permission to distribute this document be so who be mykotronx inc it would be nice to know they be not front use by intelligence or other of the government trust the fox to the chicken seem suspicious when the rest of the source fox while we it the chip design s should be verify silicon to insure no door or hide protocol exist in silicon of the security level of the encryption it would be if some three letter the to my chip when i know be someone when i to go off hook the line go could be even worse if the chip be intend to connect directly to modem the design should be do to the level doe good how to tell if there be design on silicon the model would be logic pin with the function tip off would be circuitry would ignore incoming if or sequence be not right i think of only two output pin could be use it possible might be notice but could be edit from the netlist i think the silicon itself need to be design do in two yet find third under the microscope the government be for lot of blind trust the encryption protocol the control of the device the silicon i feel like keep one on my
