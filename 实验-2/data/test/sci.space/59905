venus hot degree fahrenheit revise degree f world cloud-covered atmosphere compose primarily carbon dioxide sulfuric acid wa later confirm mariner launch november wa lose protective shroud fail eject craft wa place interplanetary space unable collect sun energy power solar panel probe soon die battery run solar orbit wa intend mar flyby mariner mariner sister probe mariner reach mar take first close-up image martian surface fly planet probe find cratered world atmosphere much thinner previously think many scientist conclude preliminary scan mar wa dead world geological biological sense mariner wa send venus reconfirm data planet collect five year earlier mariner plus information venus atmospheric pressure surface least time earth equivalent foot surface ocean mariner send mar expand upon work mariner four year earlier however fail take away concept mar dead planet first make basic measurement mariner mariner end atlantic ocean rocket launcher autopilot fail mariner sister probe mariner become first craft orbit mar return information red planet probe reveal huge volcano martian surface well giant canyon system evidence water flow across planet probe also take first detail closeup image mar two small moon phobos deimos mariner use venus gravity assist mercury probe return first close-up image venusian atmosphere ultraviolet reveal previously unseen detail cloud cover plus fact entire cloud system circle planet four earth day mariner eventually make three flybys mercury run attitude control gas probe reveal mercury heavily cratered world mass much greater think would seem indicate mercury ha iron core make percent entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter saturn flybys orbiter pioneer fail meet main objective photograph moon close-up reach far enough space provide new information area earth moon include new data van allen radiation belt circle earth three craft failure rocket launcher pioneer wa launch october pioneer november pioneer december pioneer wa moon probe miss moon become first spacecraft orbit sun pioneer wa originally design flyby venus mission wa scale instead study interplanetary environment venus earth million kilometer record mariner pioneer place solar orbit pioneer still transmit information time pioneer e would number suffer launch failure pioneer become first spacecraft flyby jupiter pioneer follow go become first probe study saturn vehicle continue function head interstellar space first craft ever pioneer venus also know pioneer venus orbiter pioneer burn venusian atmosphere october pvo make first radar study planet surface via probe pioneer venus also know pioneer send four small probe atmosphere december main spacecraft bus burn high atmosphere four probe descend parachute towards surface though none expect survive surface day probe make transmit minute grind battery fail ranger lunar lander impact mission ranger test probe ranger lunar impact series mean high earth orbit test rocket problem leave useless low orbit quickly decay ranger launch january wa intend land instrument capsule surface moon problem launch cause probe miss moon head solar orbit ranger try take image moon fly camera wa unfortunately aim deep space attempt ranger launch april purpose ranger suffer technical problem enroute crash lunar farside first probe reach moon albeit without return data ranger launch october similar ranger lose solar panel battery power enroute eventually miss moon drift solar orbit ranger modify lunar mission send back live image lunar surface head towards impact moon ranger fail objective camera operate ranger perform well become first lunar probe return thousand lunar image lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter design orbit moon image various site study land area man apollo mission probe also contribute greatly understand lunar surface feature particularly lunar farside five probe series launch essentially successful mission first probe orbit moon los eventually crash lunar surface avoid interference man apollo mission surveyor lunar soft lander surveyor series design primarily see apollo lunar module could land surface moon without sink soil time wa fear moon wa cover great layer dust would support heavy land vehicle surveyor wa successful prove lunar surface wa strong enough hold spacecraft surveyor unsuccessful mission rest become first

orbiter lander viking wa launch cape canaveral florida august titan rocket probe go martian orbit june lander set western slope chryse planitia july soon begin program search martian micro-organism still debate whether probe find life send back incredible color panorama surround one thing scientist learn wa mar sky wa pinkish color dark blue originally think sky pink due sunlight reflect reddish dust particle thin atmosphere lander set among field red sand boulder stretch far camera could image viking orbiter keep function august run attitude-control propellant lander wa switch
