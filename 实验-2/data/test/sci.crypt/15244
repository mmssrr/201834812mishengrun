possible ciphertexts particular relation word attack trivial doe actually use encryption attack call one-ciphertext n two-ciphertext n advantage formulate mathematically basic cryptology never prove cryptosystem secure read part keep say strong cryptosystem must property property guarantee cryptosystem strong contrast purpose mathematical cryptology precisely formulate possible prove statement cryptosystem strong say example cryptosystem secure passive attack nontrivial attack system define slow practical prove statement confidence cryptosystem resist passive cryptanalytic technique reduce statement well-known unsolved problem still confidence cryptosystem easy break part cryptology also amenable mathematical definition point explicitly identify assumption make prove produce desire result figure mean particular cryptosystem use properly mean assumption valid methodology useful cryptanalysis cryptanalyst take advantage incorrect assumption often try construct proof security system see proof fail use failure start point analysis one-time pad secure definition one-time pad cryptosystem plaintexts ciphertexts key string say byte string length p sum let say exclusive k p easy prove mathematically nontrivial single-ciphertext attack one-time pad assume uniform distribution key note assume uniform distribution plaintexts proof let attack algorithm take two input f g produce one output h probability p h h p whenever f f p g g p g g k p distribution k uniform independent p distribution k p must also uniform independent p also distribution c uniform independent p hence probability exactly p h h p whenever f f p g g c p c thus fortiori trivial hand one-time pad secure key k use one plaintext nontrivial multiple-ciphertext attack properly use key k must throw away one encryption key also call pad explain name one-time pad ciphertext-only attack notation ciphertext-only attack one f constant give information g n ciphertexts attack ha chance produce information h plaintexts attack trivial ha good chance produce h give g random example say g c c say h p first bite p easily write attack guess attack simply guess h p attack trivial doe use ciphertext ha fifty-fifty chance guess correctly matter hand attack rsa produce one bite information p success use c feed random c success rate drop nontrivial attack known-plaintext attack classic known-plaintext attack ha f g h depend word give two ciphertexts one decryption known-plaintext attack produce information decryption note known-plaintext attack often define literature produce information key pointless cryptanalyst generally care key insofar let decrypt message chosen-plaintext attack chosen-plaintext attack first increasingly impractical series active attack cryptosystem attack cryptanalyst fee data encryptor attack fit model passive attack explain anyway chosen-plaintext attack let cryptanalyst choose plaintext look correspond ciphertext repeat ha figure decrypt message absurd example sort attack chosen-key attack chosen-system attack much important form active attack message corruption attack attacker try change ciphertext way make useful change plaintext many easy way throw kink attack instance automatically encrypt plaintext p h r p time-key sequence number choose anew message r random number h one-way hash function comma mean concatenation plus mean exclusive-or mathematical term say brute-force attack consider follow known-plaintext attack give plaintexts p ciphertexts c also give ciphertext run every key k find k every n print n big enough one key work attack succeed valid input time produce correct result blue moon random input thus nontrivial attack problem slow many possible key key-guessing attack entropy say somebody use one-time pad choose key randomly uniformly m-bit message wa suppose security proof fact say know prefer key english word cryptanalyst run english word possible key attack often succeed much faster brute-force search entire keyspace measure bad key distribution calculate entropy number e number real bite information key cryptanalyst typically happen across key within guess e define sum probability key k
