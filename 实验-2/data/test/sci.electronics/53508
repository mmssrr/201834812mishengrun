david glen jacobowitz subject dumb question function generator new scope think save buck buy one function generator build awhile notice two thing function generator one seem bias even push pull know adjust get signal sans random bias really annoy thing damn output wo go p-p student may guess previous post often measure input impedance various circuit circuit maximum input signal way le amplitude input impedance kohm range thing order use function generator divide voltage thing reasonable course measurethe input impedance circuit go throw another resistor series output generator could ignore little divider figure kind pain way could make little box could solve little problem box would tkae function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low unchanging number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp like box active quick idea scope break reason send shop get repair replace function generator wa way one please help feel stupid today dave
