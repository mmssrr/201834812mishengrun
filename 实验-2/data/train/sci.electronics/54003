plumpe david plumpe subject make odd resistor value require filter idh ian hawkins write construct active filter odd value resistor often require something like k ohm resistor seem best choose common capacitor value cope strange resistance demand pd program work best make resistance give fix resistor standard value per decade etc common enough problem yet cant recall see program tell give rq start q find prefer value x z since worry third decimal place assume use tolerance resistor capacitor
