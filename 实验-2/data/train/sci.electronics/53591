seema seema varma subject ic package hi look help choose package high-speed silicon adc currently fabricate phd research project test chip speed pcb expect roughly package circuit dc low-speed high-speed test use different set-ups test chip know sure dip work long lead line high inductance get custom-made package expensive try choose flatpak leadless chip carrier flatpack would hard test since ha solder test setup would spend load time solder keep change test chip leadless chip carrier socket also long lead line may work high speed doe anyone field would greatly appreciate help idea name company manufacture would help multi-layer fancy gaas package seem like bite overkill seema varma
