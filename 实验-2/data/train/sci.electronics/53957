acollins andy collins subject voltage regulation current limit one not-so-quick question throw guy class project need design build power supply follow spec voltatge adjustable current limit voltage must stay within designate value ac ripple le mv rms course ca use adjustable voltage current-limiting regulator chip problem current limit find stuff rest part circuit supply must present load would draw give supply voltage reduce voltage current equal one amp thus short thing ammeter read one amp measure current ohm resistor read one amp output voltage necessity must basic idea see current limiter involve circuit pull current base output power transistor therefore reduce output doe anybody idea could work thank advance andy collins acollins p anybody want flame stupid project agree fully still grade
