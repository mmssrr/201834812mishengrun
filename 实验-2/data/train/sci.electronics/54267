warren warren gaiewski subject g h type amplifier article mark yeck write hey someone clue weird type amplifier brief intro concept behind would cool clue type b ab already stuff one mention occasionally dont know think type like pwm scheme something thanx advance whole point weird amplifier type improve efficiency class amp pwm pulse width modulation amp work much like switch power supply think see thing call class well capable high efficiency would suitable high power yet see anything like use audiophile amp though try design three-kilowatter last year use inverter serious problem layout parasitics irf parallel help do-able isolate drive ckt would appreciate absolutely positive beleive g amp one operate variable switch power supply rail voltage carver amp something like use sort phase-control circuit fully understand operation reduce transformer size beleive patent apart try fix find three rail voltage switch run simulation pspice find topology would greatly reduce power dissipation heat large-signal condition drive reactive load draw high current zero-voltage cross think speaker dr diode great sound start warren source warren
