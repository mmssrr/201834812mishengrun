et eric h taylor subject hole practical question wa philosophical question article jac jim carr write agree come nuclear physic one often discus particle-hole excitation certain reaction effect apply annihilation operator create hole subtle question longer one work real become also quasi-particles raise sort question real entity phenomenon certainly real one ok ask new thread line ask large hole current run thru resistor r cool instead heat anyone design amplifier preferentially amplify hole current normal electron current semiconductor material highest ratio hole mobility electron mobility please quote actual test sample rather estimate base theory also limit semiconductor consider also insulator resistor dielectric piezo-electrics conductor magnet metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc note summarize thread ha far state area hole detectable vacuum hole particle exist presence matter previous thread state hole exist certain semi-conductors question naturally arise hole current inside semi-conductor vanish point semiconductor join conductor say copper want theoretical discussion whether hole could exist inside metal conductor rather ask experimental discussion amplify detect current exist also note cross-posted since become electronic discussion thanx eric et force nature
