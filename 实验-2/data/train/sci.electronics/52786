mr smith subject voltage multiplier problem hi build valve preamp use voltage multiplier step supply voltage approx load resistance increase rc constant decrease hence output voltage drop need high output voltage possible circuit consist seven voltage multiplier stage ie diode capacitor capacitor develop across take output across seven capacitor increase capacitor rat increase rc constant hence alleviate problem capacitor go little expensive need would happen connect capacitor parallel output hence parallel seven capacitor assume increase c circuit hence increase rc time constant doe output voltage become stable kill two bird one stone experience ripple hence amp hum new capacitor anyone recomend suitable value inductor choke place output line power supply filter main hum lowest resistance possible get preamp moment much distraction university get get dissertation finish two week hence mail play solderoing iron cheaper long run especially new large capacitor work plan email please ca always read net thank advance chris name mr chris smith twang guitar addrs uni liverpool university quest build hardware dgree computer science ever sun may certainly ball flame gas lawrence view express reflect private think
