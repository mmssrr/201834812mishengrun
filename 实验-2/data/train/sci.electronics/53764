kubovich mark w kubovich subject common-mode noise small signal never work really small signal question low level noise notice waveform synthesizer use analogic ha relatively large common mode noise use synthesizer another transient waveform amplify difference several hundred time ha mvp-p common mode noise tend make measurement hard repeat noise quite sync line frequency spectrum analyzer main component get rid noise look spectrum use hp audio range analyzer noise go away minute switch input guess anlayzer ha diff amp input since read accurately dc also use differential amplifier ia solve problem important use one driver amp connect shield sort feedback loop remove trouble cause different cable capacitance anyone suggest good ic ia use transient signal content would appreciate
