oecjtb john bongiovanni subject summary database c library well amaze successful exercise wa receive response request summary thank everyone make possible wa able find codebase accsys codebase accsys c library without sql window application communicate window dde call send sql string receive result people write tell paradox engine borland product mention microsoft odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase odbc quadbase rbase sql decide codebase mostly ha ansi c portability version run unix etc include source code portability important application work dbase foxpro clipper file however feel microsoft odbc look promise mostly formalisation build submit sql query format query result response say available via ftp except effectively unusuable without two manual odbc programmer reference odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doe actually interpret sql liase database driver provide database manufacturer also window actually extension window sdk nevertheless start sql interface standard make life interest future original post follow response separate line asterisk doe anyone know borland microsoft library access respective database paradox foxpro within c program really like able build sql query string pas function return query result format fail access would still better nothing also like hear third party library thing people interest prepare summary tell post thank borland ha product call paradox engine doe want current version fully compatible ack paradox version different know pd engine wa compatible pdox consist rather broad library function accesing database file pascal think turbo pascal c think either microsoft borland read box borland paradox engine database framework work borland mocrosoft c later turbo c window turbo pascal later tp window later framework application bc later doe support object useage real chance really use look fairly complete plan use summer rick rick osterberg osterber harvard yard mail center cambridge usa borland ha product call paradox engine know paradox engine know well definitiely replacement sql enable save restore record ha lock et al supposedly paradox window wa impemented top charles parker phone technical support centerline software inc fax cparker cyberspace momma let yer child grow cowboy know borland ha library routine access paradox within c program recently come version work borland microsoft c compiler shailesh bhobe att psp ha put odbc sdk public domain big believe mb worth download fast link look also company start provide sql engine get one rbase exactly cheap allow program c vbasic window talk data base use sql function code hth walter knopf fermilab knopf check odbc toolikt microsoft available way choose access database apps mj ppppp sssssiiiiii specialist ms-windows windows-nt development pp ppss ii call information tool ooaid ppppp sss ii michaeljon miller mikem pp ii proficient solution inc pp sss iiiiii holmes ave minneapolis mn borland sell paradox engine c language interface paradox dbase btrieve ascus file also sell database framework include engine plus collection source c class use engine earl roethke eroethke actualy paradox engine library function large model access paradox database seem work fine never try thouroughly cost hope help david lefebvre david borland provide database lib call paradox engine access use database file aswell many thing gary bell gary bell department robotics digital technology faculty compute caulfield campus monash university australia paradox engine library paradox artur babecki artur borland sell paradox engine ha paradox call hardly sql though search key field indivual field comparison operator like pretty painful opinion anything besides simple retrieval currently use eval copy link entry screen write engine library add size program load overlay use borland vroom manager borland claim later version engine sql support really expect till late year even next year try get thrid party help question let know mike kamlet mike yes borland sell paradox engine separately ha c c pascal interface although underlie interface well least version engine cost egghead version engine separate c class package michael kersenbrock adc kentrox portland oregon michaelk uunet kentrox michaelk use accsys paradox new version almost ready paradox access paradox file c pretty good sql though hear borland paradox engine suppose likewise sure exactly hope help good luck chris fernand christopher fernandes borland sell paradox engine library function access paradox db file come library c bcc turbo pascal v believe come turbo library well c library come window flavor win stuff dll get also come crystal report graphical report generator allow create generic form use within compile program use pdox engine know still offer current price pay something like upgrade earlier version though hope help david taylor commander easier change internet specification fit program also dtaylor vice-versa root author unknown wise want sql within program check quadbase address oops yes quadbase system inc lucerne dr sunnyvale ca usa phone voice fax ask demo disk look good background embed sql ingres look real similar little expensive order demo wait probably send special offer probably run u good luck best tom delosh delosh tom delosh borland ha paradox engine library ha library c pascal access paradox file paradox believe buy sql link since pdox sql compliant use engine year pretty satisfy real pig tack size program tim associate programmer university utah email tim know microsoft borland sell paradox engine pascal one package want dbase compatible file library call codebase sequiter software work davidr david j ray use database library describe set dll access common api talk major database format use build application query several database use sql query access use use sql package available microway melbourne believe produce pioneer system u association microway pioneer system satisfy customer feel free mail information chris program nsw national park wildlife service chris hutchinson box research programmer university new england chris armidale nsw paradox engine provide complete set c library access paradox table however seem support c microsoft c try compile engine sample application waterloo watcom compiler complain library file miss even though quite certain file part watcom c engine anybody success c compiler currently develop app borland paradox engine c also come pascal ha recently go version px engine compatible paradox downward compat indeed c libs fox access ca think name offhand sure someone ha already write regard think saw add fox lib c user journal good place look type package general way pay due learn lot quirk px eng past year would recommend complex multiuser app stay like bad marriage get much time invest learn work-arounds interest limit simple single-user interface want build sql engine take px engine job easily doe sound like bump gotchas
