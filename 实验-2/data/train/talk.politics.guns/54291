quite bite personally home worth say twenty martian intent take world family balance act hard judge sit desk however another problem case civil war strength militia fight side reflect popular public split versus minority militia disadvantage need popular support would hopefully prevent insurrection unless people really behind rebel heavy weapon small fraction militia could distort minority include tank artillery owner seem case already give heavy weapon commonly citizenry low number obviously due cost think superior weapon go great effect numerically superior foe furthermore even doubtful train include proper tactical movement best utilize tank whereas commonly rifleman hamper effectiveness think vital avoid situation small minority would reasonable chance gain political power violence prevent may necessary give control heavy weapon small number individual would whose firepower would grossly distort relation popular support military strength someone individual militiaman certainly good thing think lesser two evil whoever control weapon must democratic body responsive people envision armorer perhaps officer select group like would exercise control heavier complex weapon joe bob old sherman tank certainly would ask give follow order officer yes since expense tank large though chance would jointly purchase therefore jointly maintain operate think carefull state talk certainly one role militia overthrow repressive government would completely destructive end government control militia arm unite state several level government able act independently likely target rebelion rebelions state local government unlikely think therefore state possibly local government could safely allow keep select militia heavy weapon risk abuse still something consider far le similar risk federal government control agree point state control heavy weapon justification state centrally locate keep spread ability state lock easy otherwise would assume state control would rest authority governor militia officer eaxctly think remove select militia privide militia heavy weapon highly-trained specialist reason outline think heavy weapon tank artillery aircraft etc better keep local government small number individual however local government able use select militia without support people ideally general militia direct control people select militia direction democratic local government would opperate together even worst case general militia able functional without select militia similarly select militia incapable action without aid general militia hard time see heavy weapon fairly number could easily wield people government support argue weapon divvied democratic control one side doe ca see situation alleviate select militia hold weapon unorganized militia infantry think better mix call would argue federal army rely upon select militia unorganized militia bulk infantry unit consider effect remove national guard infantry place guard control local government government-controled select militia could fight effectively without infantry support provide general militia inherently infantry organization hand general militia could function although disadvantage without back local government select militia assume would would side government-controlled force equipment infantry force size would trouble like see heavy stuff say tank offset local troups anti-tank weapon armory would much useful infantry tank would cost train requirement figure suppose quibble constitute heavy equipment mechanize infantry unit build dike time flood set disaster relief city like would much rather see thing handle local general militia would resource often available outfit local unit well enough thus certainly call others mechanize unit carry stuff faster anything else perhaps national guard close conception select militia think wa consider heavy arm militia infantry arm regular army perhaps idea heavy weapon different think main battle tank self-propelled artillery field piece heavy stuff troop carrier ton truck humvee old tank howitzer stuff mechanize infantry actually guard unit iowa currently field unit perhaps innate fear real heavy equipment state control little number light stuff act deterrent allow main battle tank state balance anti-tank capability local rank similarly local unit would need band together quickly hence small fast response mean mechanize infantry finally militia fight equipment need response federal army convince minumum infantry rely state local militia function dan sorenson dod viking isu censor read say
