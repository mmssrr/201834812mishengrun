best way find universe philosophical justification basis atheism many philosophical justification atheism find particular person choose atheist best ask many atheist feel idea god present major religion essentially self-contradictory logically impossible god could exist others atheist scepticism see evidence god exist impossible prove non-existence something many counter-examples statement example quite simple prove doe exist prime number larger prime number course deal well-defined object obey well-defined rule whether god universe similarly well-defined matter debate however assume moment existence god provably impossible still subtle reason assume non-existence god assume something doe exist always possible show assumption invalid find single counter-example hand assume something doe exist thing question provably impossible show assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible place thing might find show exhaustive search often impractical impossible problem
