demonstrate reason useful someone think reason crap wo buy see unusually weak even latter imply proof depend opinion somehow doe accept triangle wo accept pythagoras wow incredible insight prove wrong opinion possible show system leave useful information respectively claim unreliable even absurd statement information totally circular totally useless wish believe make believe thing judge appeal information make feel good believe may good contain zillion possible pitfall belief despite contrary evidence bogus proof attempt truth blatant assertion see many bogus proof non-existence god existence rational system way doe mean every data ha come logical analysis point evaluation data doe contradict logic easily follow system doe allow evaluate rational yes possible evaluate rational system rational fallacy system since validity axiom agree upon ha little impact possibility demon ala descartes doe parse sorry far matter consistency use ratiional argument show system consistent evaluation prediction doe need rationality doe contradict however argument silly prove mathematical statement need mathematics mathematics therfore circular anybody else think godel wa silly stream
