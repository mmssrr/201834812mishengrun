kempmp petri pihko subject concern god morality long kind argument cry comment jbrown write article galahad scott compton write jim originally write god create disease responsible malady newborn god create wa life accord protein code mutable evolve without delve deep discussion creationism v evolutionism god create original genetic code perfect without flaw evidence code wa perfect ha degrade ever since evidence favour statement perhaps biggest imperfection code full non-coding region intron call intervene cod region exon impressive amount evidence suggest intron ancient origin likely early exon represent early protein domain number intron decrease increase appear intron loss occur specie common ancestry usually quite similar exon-intron structure gene hand possibility intron insert later present several logical difficulty intron remove splice mechanism would present unused intron insert moreover intron insertion would require precise target random insertion would tolerate since sequence intron removal self-splicing mrna conserve besides transposition sequence usually leaf trace long terminal repeat target site duplication find near intron sequence seriously recommend read textbook molecular biology genetics post theological argument like try watson molecular biology gene darnell lodish baltimore molecular biology cell starter remember question wa pose theological context doe god cause disease newborn answer likewise theological perspective le valid purely scientific perspective different scientific perspective support evidence whereas theological perspective often fail fulfil criterion think misread mean say god make genetic code perfect doe mean perfect ha certainly evolve since worse would please cite reference support assertion assertion le valid scientific perspective unless support evidence fact ha claim parasite disease perhaps important think instance sex might evolve defence parasite view support computer simulation evolution eg tierra perhaps think wa higher energy ray like x-ray gamma ray cosmic ray cause damage fact thermal energy doe damage although usually mild easily fix enzymatic action actually neither u know atmosphere wa like time god create life accord recollection biologist claim life begin billion year ago would half billion year earth wa create would still primitive support life seem remember figure like billion year ago origination life earth anyone better estimate replace create form since need invoke creator earth form without one recent estimate age earth range billion year earliest sign life true fossil organic stromatolite-like layer date back billion year would leave billion year first cell evolve sorry ca give reference base course evolutionary biochemistry attend dominion wa great feat satan genetically engineer disease genetic although force natural selection tend improve survivability specie degeneration genetic code tend offset want true evidence suppose degeneration understand scott reaction excuse far-fetched know must jest know pathogen know point mutation know everything come spontaneously response last statement neither may well believe accept fact know hope forget evidence suggest everything come spontaneously evidence conclusion science one doe believe anything healthy sign doubt disbelieve right path walk take look evidence present one conclusion prior theology doe use method therefore seriously doubt could ever come right conclusion human dna complex tend accumulate error adversely affect well-being ability fight disease simpler dna bacteria virus tend become efficient cause infection disease bad combination hence newborn suffer genetic viral bacterial suppose purpose valid move bacteria virus exist cause disease another manifest general principle evolution replication save replicators degradiation efficient method dna survive replicate le efficient method make present last time please present evidence claim human dna degrade evolutionary process people claim opposite true suppress selection thus bind degrade see much evidence either claim ask relevant discussion answer john question genetic disease many bacterial viral disease require baby develop antibody god fault original question say course nothing evil god fault explanation doe work fail miserably may right fact know satan responsible neither suppose powerful evil like satan exist would inconceivable might responsible many ill affect mankind think could much better job pun intend problem seem satan necessary explain disease inevitable product evolution say seem like another bad inference actually oversimplify say point summary word take new context never say people mean presumably god punish get disease say free moral choice attendent consequence mankind choose reject god people since begin expect god protect adverse event entropic universe expect god exist expect leave u alone would also like hear believe choice indeed free interest philosophical question answer clear-cut seem consequence would expect reject allah oh admit perfect yet work good library bookstore good start point doe price tea china question provide answer biology genetics fine subject important scientific endeavor explain god create set life process explain behind creation life subsequent evolution behind proposition wa something support evidence recommend book need invoke behind prime mover evidence whole universe come existence without intervention recent cosmological theory hawk et al suggest people still insist thank scotty fine sagely advice highly motivate learn nitty-gritty detail biology genetics although sure find fascinate subject realize detail change big picture god create life begin ability change adapt environment sorry evidence big picture need
