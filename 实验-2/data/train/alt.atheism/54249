mcelwre subject free-energy technology free-energy technology robert e mcelwaine physicist ninety hundred year ago everybody know heavier-than-air machine could possibly fly would violate law physic expert authority say example simon newcomb declare demonstration possible combination know substance know form machinery know form force unite practical machine man shall fly long distance air seem writer complete possible demonstration physical fact fortunately smart people wright brother accept pronouncement final word take airplane grant except crash today orthodox physicist scientist say similar thing several kind energy technology use negative term pseudo-science perpetual motion cite so-called law assert energy create destroy law thermodynamics always decrease useful energy law thermodynamics physicist know certain thing arrogantly declare thing principle impotence common orthodox modern science help cover inconsistency contradiction orthodox modern theory free energy invention device tap seemingly unlimited supply energy universe burn kind fuel make perfect solution world-wide energy crisis associate pollution degradation depletion environment free energy device probably create energy rather tap exist natural energy source various form induction unlike solar wind device need little energy storage capacity tap much energy need need solar energy ha dis-advantage sun often block cloud tree build earth reduce haze smog thick atmosphere low altitude high latitude likewise wind speed widely variable often non-existent neither solar wind power suitable directly power car airplane properly design free energy device limitation example least three patent far award motor run exclusively permanent magnet seemingly tap energy circulate earth magnetic field first two require feedback network order self-running third one describe detail science mechanic magazine spring amaze magnet-powered motor jorma hyypia page front cover require critical size shape orientation space magnet feedback motor could drive electric generator reversible heatpump one home year round free complete descriptive copy patent patent office jefferson davis

logarithmic-spiral-shaped coil tube reach critical velocity water implode longer touch inside wall tube drive pump convert pump motor electric generator device seem tap energy earth rotation via effect like tornado also neutralize gravity fourth type free energy device air motor patent cross diesel engine ha three cylinder compression ratio rotary engine solar planetary gear burn fuel become self-running drive air compressor engine also generate lot heat could use heat build high torque make ideal large truck prevent slow climb hill david mcclintock also real original inventor automatic transmission differential drive crystal may someday use supply energy show star trek show perhaps insert one metal capacitor plate bombard beam particle small radioactive source like use common household smoke detector one energy source mention despite fact doe fit definition free energy bulgarian-born american physicist name joseph maglich ha invent partially develop atomic fusion reactor call us non-radioactive deuterium fuel available nearly unlimited quantity sea water doe produce radioactive waste convert directly electricity with-out energy-wasting steam turbine construct small enough power house large enough power city unlike tokamak laser fusion monstrosity read migma work already produce least three watt power every watt put new time version page fusion experiment news lately originally conduct university utah researcher b stanley pons martin fleischmann navy researcher china lake naval weapon center california direction chemist melvin mile finally take trouble collect bubble come apparatus analyze mass-spectrometry technique find helium prof atomic fusion indeed take place enough explain excess heat generate good indication two so-called law thermodynamics absolute example late physicist dewey b larson develop comprehensive general unify theory physical universe call system describe detail several book nothing motion universe motion physical universe ha two distinct half material half anti-matter half continuous cycle matter energy pass with-out heat death predict thermodynamic law theory explain universe much better modern orthodox theory include phenomenon orthodox physicist astronomer still scratch head self-consistent every way free energy device might tap energy flow seemingly convert low-quality energy high-quality energy also certain religious organization mat teach member physical universe lowest least dozen major level existence like parallel universe analogous tv channel describe book like path master dr julian johnson eckankar key secret world sri paul twitchell example next level physical universe commonly call plane long-time member group learn travel higher world report condition seem plausible energy could flow higher level physical universe create boundary give right configuration matter channel support many successful laboratory-controlled experiment psycho-kinesis throughout world describe book psychic discovery behind iron curtain term economics market ha fail inventor enough money resource fully develop mass-produce free energy equipment conventional energy producer desire ted intere government need intervene government doe intervene total supply energy resource earth continue decline soon run price energy increase pollution harmful effect include effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spill rape land strip mine etc continue increase government subsidize research development free energy inventor university subsidize private production producer make subsidize consumption low-income consumer free energy hardware long-range effect government intervention would wide-spread profound quantity energy demand conventional energy producer coal mine companie oil companie country electric utilitie etc would drop near zero force employee seek work elsewhere energy resource coal uranium oil gas would leave grind price conventional energy supply would also drop near zero price free energy equipment would start high drop supply increase happen vcr personal computer etc cost produce product require large quantity energy produce would decrease along price consumer consumer would able realize opportunity cost pay electric utility bill buy home heat fuel tourism would benefit increase traveler would spend money gasoline car government tax revenue gasoline fuel would obtain way energy could longer use motive excuse make war many conventional energy producer would go business society whole earth environment ecosystem would benefit greatly people government serve rather big corporation bank information answer question etc please consult cite source patent article book un-altered reproduction dissemination important information encourage robert e
