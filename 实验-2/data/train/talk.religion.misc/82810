state believe begin stage debate lay scriptural groundwork expand upon deeper exegesis db course reason see drastically reinterpret passage ha juda death make agree another passage could consider correct reply one reason give different exegetical view passage seem think majority scholarship wrong conclude passage complimentary however see problem tony rise explanation juda death would explain inaccuracy juda hang matthew fall headlong burst open question manner juda die one constantly confront travel many people point apparent discrepancy two account obvious irreconcilable error go far say idea inerrant bible destroy contradictory account however case matthew relate juda hang peter tell u fell wa crush impact two statement indeed different necessarily contradict matthew doe say juda

entrails gush act write book psalm dwell place desolate let one live another take office may graphic explanation juda death line reason dispel contradiction myth two account juda death matthew doe necessarily explain juda die doe say juda hang specifically say juda die hang incident however act seem show u graphic demise therefore contradiction matthew act juda death reply know matthew hang act probably record death although possible plausible fell hang hit rock thereby burst open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say juda die result hang scholar believe probably quote show highly regard scholar explanation look text initially ca assume juda die however highly probable db way agree juda die hang book different way deal contradiction discuss one simply ignore entirely simply refer back matthew version correct version matt act biblical knowledge commentary suggest hypothesis juda hang rot belly explode doe explain headlong fall branch rope break fell death gut gush doe explain hang man would fall headlong rather foot first reply outcome fall dependent upon many factor high person wa suspend fall obstruction tree branch may deviate fall steep incline rocky

word bible guarantee true god thereby add one contradiction death juda ie prophesy potter field come reply please study death remind discus db second question mr decenso ask could sure money juda purchase land wa indeed betrayal rather source would point act specifically mention reward iniquity act also specifically mention act iniquity talk ie act concern juda wa guide arrest jesus would point bible describe act iniquity immediately discus reward iniquity would rather inane suggest wa action iniquity one discuss reply dave get somewhere act day peter stand midst disciple altogether number name wa hundred twenty say act men brother scripture fulfil holy spirit speak mouth david concern juda become guide arrest jesus act wa number u obtain part ministry act man purchase field wage iniquity fall headlong burst open middle entrails gush act become know dwell jerusalem field call language akel dama field blood act write book psalm dwell place desolate let one live another take
