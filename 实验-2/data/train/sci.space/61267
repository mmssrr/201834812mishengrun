subject gamma ray burster energetic could belgarath article jfc john f carr write gamma ray burster extragalactic would absorption galaxy expect transparent galactic core gamma ray much energy doe burster put know energy depend distance unknown answer form x erg per ok john carr jfc turn one problem set class little problem calculator problem set long ago use hope want highly simplify problem simple burst burst usually complex example use burst ha peak flux erg duration second frst second burst last second flux half peak flux flux peak flux rest time assume background flux erg find integrate luminosity burst several different sphere oort cloud radius edge galaxy edge galactic corona lastly integrate flux time find fluence use old standby formula pi fpeak radius pc find l around pretty energetic close coronal model find around lastly cosmological model call moderately energetic say suggestion could put much energy one second jeremy
