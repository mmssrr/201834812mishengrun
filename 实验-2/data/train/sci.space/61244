planet mercury ha observe precisely measure advance rate second arc per century second advance attribute via calculation gravitational perturbation planet venus earth jupiter etc remain second arc use help prove einstein general theory relativity late physicist dewey b larson achieve result closer second general relativity instead use special relativity one book apply lorentz transformation high orbital speed mercury larson totally reject general relativity another mathematical fantasy also reject special relativity include part mass increase near speed light use lorentz transform doppler shift quasar red-shifts greater really move faster speed light although motion away u time larson comprehensive general unify theory physical universe three dimension time instead one two dimension measure material half physical universe one dimension measure clock time low relative speed value two dimension negligible high speed become significant lorentz transformation must use fudge factor larson often use term coordinate time write regard mass increase ha prove atomic accelerator acceleration drop toward zero near speed light formula acceleration acceleration force mass orthodox physicist ignore third factor force larson theory mass stay constant force drop toward zero force actually motion combination motion relation motion include inward outward scalar motion expansion universe example outward scalar motion inherent universe result so-called big bang yet another mathematical fantasy universe motion wish recommend everyone book universe motion dewey b larson north

explode galaxy etc contain astronomer astrophysicist look ready seriously consider open mind follow example theory success first book structure physical universe larson predict existence explode galaxy several year astronomer start find necessary consequence larson comprehensive theory quasar discover immediate relate explanation also gamma-ray burst astro-physicists astronomer still scratch head mysterious gamma-ray burst originally think originate neutron star disc galaxy new gamma ray telescope earth orbit ha detect direction uniformly source location space correspond know object

gamma-ray burst come supernova explosion anti-matter half physical universe larson call cosmic sector relationship anti-matter material half physical universe way connect together gamma-ray burst pop material half anywhere space seemingly random source location burst correspond know object come direction uniformly wonder close u space source location would gamma-ray burst kill life earth would way predict one stop perhaps mass extinction past blame impact comet asteroid actually cause nearby gamma-ray burst larsonian binary star formation half star galaxy vicinity sun binary double orthodox astronomer astrophysicist still satisfactory theory form many binary star system actually likely consequence comprehensive general unify theory physical universe develop late physicist dewey b larson try summarize larsons explanation detail chapter book universe motion book first accord larson star generate energy fusion small fraction come slow gravitational collapse rest result complete annihilation heavy element heavier iron element ha destructive temperature limit heavier element lower limit star internal temperature increase grow mass via accretion absorption decay product cosmic ray gradually reach destructive temperature limit lighter lighter element internal temperature star reach destructive temperature limit iron type supernova explosion much iron present relate structure iron atom atom build process larson explain book better star explode lighter material outer portion star blow outward space le speed light heavier material center portion star wa already bounce around close speed light high temperature explosion push material speed light expand outward time equivalent inward space often actually disappear long period time mass start fall back gravitationally material blow outward space start form red giant star material blow outward time start form white dwarf star star start move back toward main sequence opposite direction h-r diagram chance two mass fall back exact location space make single lone star near zero instead form binary system orbit accord larson white dwarf star ha inverse density gradient densest surface material center widely disperse blow outward time eliminate need resort mathematical fantasy degenerate matter neutron star black hole etc larsonian solar system formation mass heavy material center explode star relatively small instead single white dwarf star several mini white dwarf star revolve around red giant star probably still far away three-dimensional time affect heat etc become planet chapter universe motion larson use information principle comprehensive general unify theory physical universe derive version bode law black hole fantasy hear physicist stephen w hawk recently complete theoretical mathematical analysis two black hole merge together single black hole conclude new black hole would mass sum two original black hole result recognize everyone red flag cause widespread doubt whole idea black hole etc read physicist dewey b larson book comprehensive general unify theory physical universe especially book universe motion clear black hole nothing mathematical fantasy strange object cygnus unusually massive white dwarf star black hole orthodox astronomer physicist badly want prove theory way understand much publicity give physicist stephen hawk physicist astronomer seem act hawk severe physical problem somehow make wiser doe wish attention give physicist dewey b larson wa still alive widespread publicity attention give larson theory book organization international society unify science electro-magnetic propulsion hear concept many year ago connection ufo unorthodox inventor never wa able find work construct find possible clue might work page book basic property matter late physicist dewey b larson describe part larson comprehensive general unify theory physical universe quote one paragraph indicate precede chapter development theory universe motion arrive totally different concept nature electrical resistance electron find derive environment wa bring volume larson book nothing motion physical process operation produce electron substantial quantity although motion constitute electron many case absorb atomic structure opportunity utilize type motion structure limit follow always large excess free electron material sector material half universe uncharged uncharged state electron move respect extension space inherently rotate unit space relation space space motion open space therefore uncharged electron remain permanently location respect natural reference system manner photon context stationary spatial reference system uncharged electron like photon carry outward speed light progression natural reference system material aggregate thus expose flux electron similar continual bombardment photon radiation meanwhile process discuss later whereby electron return environment electron population material aggregate earth therefore stabilize equilibrium level note larson theory uncharged electron also massless basically photon light particular frequency unit frequency spin around one axis particular rate unit rate unit velocity speed light vibrational rotational equivalent speed light accord larson theory might label mix larson say outer space fill mass le un-charged electron fly around speed light true electro-magnetic propulsion field spacecraft might able interact electron particle space perhaps give charge mass shoot toward rear achieve propulsion larson theory electrical charge one-dimensional rotational vibration
