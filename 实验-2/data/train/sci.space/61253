northern hemisphere venus venus balloon year thick atmosphere venus tempt target scientist wish explore planet mantle air balloon-borne instrument professor jacques blamont french space agency centre national spatiales cnes propose idea far back joint french-soviet balloon mission cancel nevertheless late year dream would eventually come true two proton rocket send skyward december soviet union provide western observer first clear full view booster launch every soviet venus probe since wa one many first complex mission unman probe launch space december name vega contraction word venera gallei gallei russian word halley spacecraft one mission perform also one celestial objective explore namely comet halley famous periodic traveler wa make latest return inner region solar system since last visit since wa widely believe comet icy remain formation solar system five billion year ago scientist around world give high priority explore one body actually come close earth comet linger cold dark outer fringe solar system like halley perturb various force fall towards sun circle millennium spew ice debris million kilometer warmth solar encounter soviet union along european space agency esa japan institute space astronautical science isas wish miss first opportunity human history make close examination halley esa would use cylindrical giotto probe make dangerously close photographic flyby comet japan first deep space craft sakigake pioneer suisei comet would view halley much safer distance scientist unite state also desire study comet vantage space probe one time envision vessel power solar sail ion engine however government budget cut nasa cancel american effort would make primarily earth-based observation share data nation though instrument name dust counter mass analyzer ducma design chicago university professor john simpson wa add soviet mission may soviet answer halley vega instead build entirely new craft mission soviet decide modify venera bus design encounter comet perform advance venus mission along way vega reach venus bus would drop one use mass shroud planet swing towards comet halley much probe mariner use venus flyby mercury eleven year earlier soviet craft would head halley help pinpoint location comet erupt nucleus giotto probe dive kilometer mile away march plan two vega arrive venus june vega release payload first ninth day month lander make two-day descent towards planet craft touch upper atmosphere morning june sixty-one kilometer mile venerean surface small container wa release lander produce parachute kilometer mile altitude thus first balloon probe ever explore venus successfully arrive one kilometer open parachute helium gas wa pump teflon-coated plastic balloon inflate diameter meter foot dangle tether thirteen meter foot wa instrument package properly know aerostat top part aerostat consist cone serve antenna tether attachment point balloon beneath wa transmitter electronics instrument connect bottom wa nephelometer measure cloud particle aerostat wa paint special white finish keep bay corrode mist sulfuric acid permeate planet atmosphere vega balloon wa drop night side venus north equator scientist concern gas

probe help reveal comet dark irregular-shaped mass fourteen kilometer mile across rotate every hour give take three hour since vega craft still function halley encounter soviet scientist consider option send probe celestial object one prime target wa near earth planetoid adonis vega could pas distance six million kilometer million mile sadly soviet back opportunity become first nation fly spacecraft past planetoid wa discover wa enough maneuver fuel probe reach adonis plan vega quietly shut early future plan divert impressive vega mission give scientist numerous idea hope even ambitious expedition second world sun one example wa vesta mission plan early soviet-french collaboration call launch multiple probe single proton rocket either craft would first swing venus drop several lander balloon probe aerostats would design survive planet corrosive atmosphere one month large improvement vega balloon two day mission would head investigate several planetoid comet include possible land vesta thus mission name reflective main belt planetoid see earth unfortunately venus exploration plan begin change soviet union soviet decide reroute vesta mission red planet mar instead venus keep comet planetoid aspect intact time soviet space program interest wa focus mar already construction wa entirely new probe design call phobos two member class plan leave earth orbit mar next year phobos would place first instrument mar largest moon phobos wa prelude even advance mar expedition include balloon probe rover soil sample return craft eventually human explorer early twenty-first century environment venus wa hostile serious consideration human colonization near future thing begin look bleak soviet venus mar exploration phobos probe fail complete mission one lose contact way red planet go silent mar orbit one week plan moon land march plan wa devise venus orbiter drop eight ten penetrator around planet several year later mission launch date wa move year ha put indefinite hold official soviet mission venus since put forth sad commentary twenty-five year continuous robotic exploration planet late drastic political economic change wa take soviet union president mikhail gorbachev begin open nation benefit increase cooperation rest nation particularly west culture become le oppressive past economy wa take rough ride also undergo effect free market effect hit everywhere include space program mission level cut back soviet begin make almost desperate attempt cooperate space-faring nation either keep remain program alive make money early wa report soviet offer sale several fully-equipped veneras storage price million dollar incredibly low price planetary probe nation take bargain meanwhile unite state wa gear new venus mission magellan galileo reactivate long-dormant planetary exploration launch space shuttle atlantis may aboard shuttle wa magellan spacecraft combination spare part probe design make detail complete radar-mapping venus history magellan reach second world august would able map almost entire planet resolution meter foot surpass ability venera interim another american probe wa launch space shuttle would make quick flyby venus way orbit giant planet jupiter october shuttle atlantis release second unman planetary probe space name galileo famous italian astronomer discover probe primary target major moon absence
