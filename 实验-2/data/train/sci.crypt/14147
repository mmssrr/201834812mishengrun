ripem ripem program perform privacy enhance mail pem use cryptographic technique rsa de allow electronic mail property authentication send confirm privacy nobody read except intend recipient ripem wa

popular mailer include berkeley mush elm mh code also include elisp allow easy use ripem inside gnu emacs make new interface ripem create improvement one distribution believe convenient use secure may useful others feel free post rsa rsa crypto system asymmetric public-key mean two different relate key one encrypt one decrypt one reasonably derive may publish encryption public key widely keep decryption private key anyone use public key encrypt message hold private key need decrypt note message send rsa normally de key real message see de note provide privacy authentication fingerprint message see fingerprint like encrypt sender private key recipient use sender public key decrypt confirm message must come sender rsa wa name three men rivest shamir adleman invent find rsa ftp look look de de data encryption standard widely use symmetric secret-key crypto system unlike rsa de us key encrypt decrypt message however de much faster rsa ripem us de rsa generate random key encrypt mail de use key encrypt key recipient public rsa key include result letter allow recipient recover de key de sometimes consider weak somewhat old us key length consider short modern standard however reasonably safe opponent smaller large corporation government agency unlikely future ripems strengthen symmetric cipher possibly use multiple encryption de pem doe ripem relate pem privacy enhance mail system allow easy transfer encrypt electronic mail describe rfcs document approve obsolete old rfcs ripem really complete implementation pem pem specify certificate authenticate key ripem doe handle time addition plan distribute authenticate key remote user able send secure mail must know public key able confirm message receive come must know public key important information accurate bad guy convince key fact send message read ripem allow three method key management central server distribute finger server flat file three describe ripem user guide part distribution none provide perfect security ripem public key look similar ripem public key begin pkcs identifier describe various characteristic key first bunch character key may lot people key doe mean key similar class key generate program length etc fingerprint like message digest algorithm produce rsa data security inc provide fingerprint cryptographically secure hash plaintext cryptographically secure possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext produce fingerprint thus instead sign entire message sender private key message need sign authentication sometimes use purpose example often use map input arbitrary length bite data passphrase interpreter cookie generator describe entirety include implementation c rfc pgp pgp another cryptographic mail program call pretty good privacy pgp ha around longer ripem work somewhat differently pgp compatible ripem way though pgp doe also use rsa major difference pgp ripem pgp ha key management feature particularly user without direct network connection ripem conform pem rfcs thus ha greater probability work pem software pgp make attempt compatible anything pgp fact pgp compatible pgp ripem us rsaref library rsa routine rsa data security inc rsaref come license allow noncommercial use pgp us implementation rsa license thus pkp firm hold patent rsa algorithm claim infringement patent make use sell pgp canada acknowledgement pgp original author phil zimmermann say documentation fact live usa federal agency actually run pgp computer public key partner want forbid run software pgp contraband pgp ripem export-restricted send outside canada however pgp already exist many ftp site europe place whether use pgp ripem whatever documentation pgp recommend read anyone interest issue note fact regard patent export restriction somewhat controversial many people think way people interpret various document differently unfortunately discussion net inevitably seem produce heat light probably belong see disclaimer rpem rpem stand rabin privacy enhance mail wa similar ripem use public-key cipher invent rabin rsa attempt avoid patent rsa wa write mark riordan author ripem distribution wa halt contrary belief many include rabin public key partner pkp claim patent wa broad enough cover public-key cipher whose strength rest difficulty factor product large prime rsa claim universally accept mean wa challenge pragmatic reason rpem really use anymore compatible ripem pgp mime mime stand multipurpose internet mail extension describe rfc find newsgroup pem interact mime yet entirely clear people use stopgap solution mime type order send ripem message mime one hope standard emerge draft internet document exist matter simple way defeat security ripem may wish check companion post ripem-attacks discus obvious attack
