mvanheyn marc vanheyningen subject ripem frequently note vulnerability archive-name last-update mar possible attack ripem live list potential weakness keep eye open use ripem secure electronic mail doe go great detail almost certainly exhaustive obviously many weakness weakness cryptographically secure mail general pertain secure mail program ripem maintain marc vanheyningen mvanheyn post monthly variety news group followup pertain specifically ripem go cryptanalysis attack break rsa would allow attacker find private key case could read mail encrypt sign message private key rsa generally believe resistant standard cryptanalytic technique even standard key bite ripem long enough render impractical bar huge investment hardware breakthrough factor break de would allow attacker read give message since message encrypt de would allow attacker claim de ha bite key thus could conceivably compromise brute force sufficient hardware agency money devote simply read one message since message ha different de key work message would remain high key management attack steal private key would allow benefit break rsa safeguard encrypt de key derive passphrase type however attacker get copy private keyfile passphrase snoop network packet tap line whatever could break whole scheme main risk transfer either passphrase private key file across untrusted link run ripem trust machine preferably one sit right front ideally machine home maybe office nobody else ha physical access fool accept bogus public key someone else could allow opponent deceive send secret message rather real recipient enemy fool intend recipient well could re-encrypt message bogus public key pas along important get proper public key people common mechanism finger assume opponent ha compromise router daemon finger give fair amount trust strongest method key authentication exchange key person however always practical people vouch sign statement contain key possible although ripem doe feature automatically pgp ripem doe generate check fingerprint public key key file may exchange via separate channel authentication playback attack even opponent break cryptography opponent could still cause difficulty example suppose send message mic-only pem mode doe provide disclosure protection alice say ok let opponent intercept resends bob ha message authenticate tell course may interpret entirely different context opponent could transmit message recipient much later figure would see differently later time opponent could change originator-name register public key send message hop recipient send return mail indicate perhaps even quote unknown message defeat playback attack plaintext message include indication sender recipient unique identifier typically date good front-end script ripem automatically imho recipient sure originator-name header sender indicate within plaintext really recipient message old one also automate author faq ha make modest attempt automate process generate check encapsulate header program include standard distribution utils directory local attack clearly security ripem greater security machine encryption perform example unix super-user could manage get encrypt mail although would take plan effort something like replace ripem executable trojan horse get copy plaintext depend store addition link machine run ripem extension decrypt ripem remote machine connect via network worse yet modem eavesdropper could see plaintext probably also passphrase ripem execute system trust obviously extreme case ripem use machine total control nobody else ha access ha carefully examine software know free virus however real trade-off convenience security moderately cautious user might use ripem unix workstation people access even root access increase security keep private key statically link course executable floppy disk people keep ripem multi-user system dial insecure line download message system perform ripem decryption however security provide mechanism somewhat illusory since presumably type cleartext password log give away store since attacker log install trap account steal private key next time use le insecure line likely remain situation long system use rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authentication find nice put brief statement carefully manage security arrangement plan next public key potential correspondent aware level precaution place people use two key short one carefully manage ordinary use longer one treat greater care critical correspondence untrusted partner attack ripem encryption ensure person private key correspond public key use encrypt data may read traffic however someone key get message may always make whatever kind transformation wish exist cryptographic barrier recipient say take encrypt message convert mic-only message sign readable anyone although ripem doe provide functionality indeed latest pem draft see specifically state transformation possible allow forward function work include recipient plaintext mention make possible recipient redistribute message aware original nature naturally security cryptography never greater security people use
