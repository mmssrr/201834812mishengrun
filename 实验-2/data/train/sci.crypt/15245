cbw ftpcb use compression encryption number people propose perfect compression follow simple encryption method xor repeat key unfortunately compress perfectly know exact distribution possible input practical purpose impossible describe typical english text beyond coarse characteristic single-letter frequency build sophisticate model input enemy ha slightly accurate model able find redundancy compress output note nearly practical compression scheme unless design cryptography mind produce output actually start high redundancy example output unix compress begin well-known three-byte magic number serve enter wedge cryptanalysis say compression encryption inherently bad idea ha carefully mean remove need strong encryption compression encryption silly unbreakable cipher yes one-time pad unbreakable see part unfortunately one-time pad require secure distribution much key material plaintext course cryptosystem need utterly unbreakable useful rather need strong enough resist attack likely enemy whatever length time data protect expect remain valid doe random mean cryptography cryptographic application demand much pseudorandom number generator application source bite cryptographically random must computationally impossible predict nth random bite give complete knowledge algorithm hardware generate stream sequence bite n lifetime source software generator also know pseudo-random ha function expand truly random seed longer string apparently random bite seed must large enough guess opponent ideally also truly random perhaps generate hardware random number source sparcstation workstation could example generate random number use audio input device source entropy connect anything example cat compress foo give file high entropy random much randomness one encrypt file use part key example convert seed entropy pseudo-random string look hardware device provide entropy important really measure entropy rather assume look complicate human must random example disk operation completion time sound like might unpredictable many people spin disk much like clock output completion time relatively low entropy unicity point unicity distance see unicity distance approximation amount ciphertext sum real information entropy correspond source text encryption key equal number ciphertext bite use ciphertexts significantly longer show probably unique decipherment use back claim validity ciphertext-only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter likely multiple equally valid decryption therefore gain security opponent difficulty choose correct one unicity distance like statistical information-theoretic measure doe make deterministic prediction rather give probabilistic result namely minimum amount ciphertext likely single intelligible plaintext correspond ciphertext possible key try decryption work cryptologist normally deal unicity distance instead directly determine likelihood event interest let unicity distance cipher character fewer ciphertext character intercept enough information distinguish real key set possible key de ha unicity distance character le ciphertext block block correspond ascii character may seem alarmingly low first unicity distance give indication computational work require find key approximately character intercept fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceed along line use discuss unicity distance like measure key size unicity distance something guarantee insecurity small doe guarantee security high practical cryptosystems absolutely impervious analysis manner characteristic might serve enter wedge crack cipher message however similar information-theoretic consideration occasionally useful example determine recommend key change interval particular cryptosystem cryptanalyst also employ variety statistical information-theoretic test help guide analysis promise direction unfortunately literature application information statistic cryptanalysis remain classify even seminal work alan turing see insight possibility see key management important one fundamental axiom cryptography enemy full possession detail general cryptographic system lack specific key data employ encryption course one would assume cia doe make habit tell mossad cryptosystems mossad probably find anyway repeat use finite amount key provide redundancy eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially modern communication system vast amount information transfer party must sound cryptosystem also enough key material cover traffic key management refer distribution authentication handle key publicly

ciks use authorize cryptographic control personnel validate issuance individual traffic key perform function report lose ciks give inkling extent key management problem public-key system several relate issue many trust use pseudo-random chaotic number key stream chaotic equation fractal produce apparent randomness relatively compact generator perhaps simplest example linear congruential sequence one popular type random number generator obvious dependence seed output unfortunately graph sequence high enough dimension show regular lattice mathematically lattice correspond structure notoriously easy cryptanalyst exploit complicate generator complicate structure make interest picture cryptographically strong sequence computable structure see exercise correct frequency list english letter three answer question slightly deeper one find first answer various book namely frequency list compute directly certain sample english text course list correctly compute exactly list get depend sample wa take second answer question doe make sense mean english letter english language fix finite close object exactly characterize ha change time different different author particular message different statistic language whole third answer yes particular message go exactly characteristic english general reasonable statistical us slight discrepancy wo matter fact entire field call bayesian statistic buzzword maximum entropy method maximum likelihood estimation study question like chance text letter frequency english come reasonably robust answer make list sample english text good enough practical work use properly enigma project data security look source information german enigma code wa break british wwii see shuffle card card shuffle special case permutation array value use random pseudo-random function possible output permutation process equally likely need random function modran x produce uniformly distribute random integer interval give function shuffle follow c code assume arrlth length array arr swap interchange value two address give n n n swap arr modran arr n modran x achieve exactly simple ranno x since ranno interval may divisible x although case error small cover case one take ranno modulus mod x call number ranno return value le go back get another ranno value foil pirate encrypt cd-rom someone frequently express desire publish cd-rom possibly multiple piece
