rws ronald w schmidt subject outline spline surface year ago start work problem appear simple turn quite difficult wonder anyone net ha see problem hopefully publish solution problem draw outline surface define two roughly parallel cubic spline input problem essentially start two set point set point edge object treat two dimensional extant edge exist three dimensional space draw object fit cubic spline point spline effectively compute sequence line segment approximate curve spline ha equal number segment assume nth segment along spline roughly exactly distance along spline reasonable measure take segment n along spline match nth segment oppose spline use pair segment form two triangle fill color surface depth sort triangle take triangle sort order project onto pixmap draw color triangle take edge triangle along edge surface draw line along edge color special edge color edge color step heart problem idea effectively outline edge surface net result however generally ha lot break gap edge surface reason fairly complicate involve rasterization problem problem result project spline anything problem sound familiar would appreciate know work area thank
