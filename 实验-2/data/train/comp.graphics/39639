broehl bernie roehl subject optimize projection article lioness write three-d library doe lot projection duh currently project object vertex per triangle basis grossly inefficient object display optimize projection one time vertex object whose z-extents intersect hither plane ca benefit new vertex must create z-clipping anyone better idea yes keep vertex array polygon triangle okay n-sided polygon slightly efficient store index array vertex comprise set flag vertex transform transform vertex also backface elimination process polygon vertex belong bacfacing polys transform whenever transform vertex check far side hither plane project right away store result z clip vertex get produce projection stage bernie roehl university waterloo dept electrical computer engineer mail broehl voice x work
