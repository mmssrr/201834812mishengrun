prohibit usage radar detector new york prohibit use large truck canada illegal manitoba ontario quebec newfoundland pei prince edward island apparently illegal europe legislation would make illegal pending many jurisdiction chance legislation pass vary great deal q radar detector detector use really work usage spread rapidly initially use canada appear new york virginia unsafe assume use connecticut work detect certain frequency radiate many currently available super het radar detector brand detector radiate strongly others thus likely spot new radar detector become available may detect current generation detector detector note detector may spot one device turn q vascar kind radar vascar nothing fancy stopwatch time-speed-distance computer depend operator press button target vehicle pass landmark radar signal emit vascar system q ka band radar use radar detector able handle ka band ha recently make available fcc use u so-called photo-radar installation installation low-powered beam aim across road degree angle direction traffic picture take vehicle radar unit determine violation speed limit ticket mail owner vehicle low power degree angle many people believe radar detector give reasonable warn ka band radar unit although manufacturer radar detector add capability anyway number locale photo-radar use limit question legality unit best advice learn photo radar unit look like keep track use else speed q radar jammer work legal quick answer usa detail answer cheap radar jammer work well jammer work expensive usually property military jammer major violation regulation federal communication commission usa drive technique vehicle dynamic question q understeer oversteer understeer oversteer term describe behaviour car corner near limit limit adhesion driver normally drive hard enough term descriptive situation encounter simply put tell whether car want go straight corner steer le understeer want turn corner oversteer understeer commonly design production car untrained driver inadvertantly travel fast wo get trouble understeer may also induce use much throttle corner oversteer design performance orient car may induce lift throttle trail throttle oversteer tto extreme case lift throttle may induce much oversteer car react fishtail spin technical detail corner speed tire car develop call slip angle slip angle angular difference direction car travel direction steer wheel direct car travel understeer front wheel greater slip angle rear wheel oversteer rear wheel greater slip angle front wheel q rev-matched downshift downshifting engine must rotate faster lower gear wa higher gear however downshift normally declutch lift foot throttle rev drop rather increase rev-matched downshift blip throttle re-engaging clutch engine already new speed result much smoother faster downshift q doe heel-and-toe mean heel-and-toe technique use rev-matched downshift brake normally challenge need right foot brake throttle call heel-and-toe use one end foot brake throttle match rev downshift many modern car misnomer often must use ball foot brake right side throttle note race car driver skip clutch use leave foot brake right foot throttle accomplish thing q double-clutch downshifting right foot leave foot one three thing nothing declutch declutch twice reason declutch twice match speed two shaft transmission speed engine usually couple rev-matching engine neutral clutch engage throttle blipped shaft transmission speed procedure follow declutch move gearshift lever neutral engage clutch match rev declutch move gearshift lever next lower gear engage clutch sound like lot work practice become natural problem double-clutching solve normally function synchronizer within gearbox transmission without synchro wear synchro double-clutching make much easier shift basically double-clutch well use synchro generally unnecessary street car synchro good condition q number acceleration mile skidpad slalom time auto magazine really mean may compare short much magazine want believe almost never detail acceleration number mile time u may vaguely compare long come source test procedure vary much magazine magazine compare road track number car driver number quite pointless keep mind variation apply driver driver street driver major often major part equation skidpads vary even skidpad figure really test stickiness stock tire change radically tire compound change make assumption comparative handle say two sport sedan base skidpad number suggest skidpads without value however skidpads excellent educational tool drive school simply limit value comparison anything except tire slalom time slightly useful test small part automobile transient response however also heavily influence stock rubber car test many corner car envelope tell need know make buy decision example tell rear end car road suddenly go off-camber car ha adjustable suspension test usually sport set may quite unsuitable daily drive list caveat could go page page q buddy claim wide tire make difference accord freshman physic textbook ca ever accelerate corner doe know talk short ha get clue detail equation friction use freshman physic textbook presume surface smooth dry non-deformable none properly apply tire traction except case stone cold tire dry pavement far proper operate temperature pavement never smooth always irregular greater lesser extent tire really dry solid rubber substance natural form liquid ha coerce semblance solidity chemical magic deform match surface pavement vehicle travel tire operate temperature grip actually generate shear stress inside deform rubber anything even remotely resemble friction freshman physic sense term colder tire relative operate temperature closer behaviour traditional concept friction much hotter proper operate temperature likely possibility part tire actually revert liquid mostly like happen deep tread cause characteristic blister chunk latter though almost completely unlikely happen normal street drive unless competition driver lot high speed track drive worry tire traction completely domain simple friction doe obey freshman physic equation thus dragsters accelerate race car corner brake simple friction doe apply actually possible different size contact patch generate differ amount grip actual analysis tire behavior would require technique finite element analysis due complexity mechanism misc question q doe name acronym stand list name commonly ask careful solicit mean name misinformation abound net particular never ask want useful
