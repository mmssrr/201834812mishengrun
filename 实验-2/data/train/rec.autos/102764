change april revise brake fluid section non-silicone fluid apparently available rpw commonly ask automotive question tire question q funny number side tire mean typically see something like overall width tire millimeter tread usually narrower aspect ratio indicate height sidewall tire relative overall width example tire ha sidewall height mm wheel diameter inch also special tire call trx tire three digit metric wheel diameter designation like millimeter r mean radial h speed rat indicate highest speed tire properly inflate carry appropriate load may safely operate common speed rat h v recent change method specify tire size move speed rat different part designation may therefore find designation like indicate per-tire load associate speed rat exceed load continuous operation rat speed dangerous practice follow table show number load index correspond maximum per-tire load load index max load kg note usual mass v weight confusion occur table case letter p lt may find front tire size lt designation indicate light truck p designation indicate passenger car letter give application tire passenger car usage far know letter appear u market lt designation prinicipally interest owner light truck utility vehicle owner passenger vehicle meaningful difference tire p designation one designation aspect ratio omit probably may tire designation may speed rat reduce additional set rat tire temperature traction treadwear temperature traction grade b c best c worst treadwear numeric rat value limit value assign somewhat arbitrarily tire manufacturer thus useful compare different brand tire q car ha tire funny size designation put normal tire car tire call trx tire devise michelin somewhat different bead design incompatible normal tire michelin use different diameter wheel could mount wrong type wheel conventional tire could mount trx type wheel need aquire different wheel put normal tire car barely possible fit normal tire trx wheel horribly dangerous tire may simply peel rim corner possibly blow high speed trx type tire become hard find addition michelin avon make suitable tire goodyear ha apparently discontinue line trx tire q rotate radial side side rotate one side car car tire manufacturer differ view subject many say swap radial leave right hand side car ok group include michelin goodyear others example pirelli nokia void warranty swap best advice read tire manual carefully rotate tire stick manufacturer recommendation q many snow tire buy buy end car put short end explain many driver area get excessive snow drive agressively snow condition get away two snow drive wheel circumstance dangerous practice rear wheel drive car choose able start car go function rear axle stop turn car function front axle front wheel drive car start stop turn front end primary risk put snow tire front put brake go downhill run serious risk go downhill backwards radar detector speed limit q comment radar detector speed limit q post question detector speed limit crossposted always start long tedious pointless flame war want talk either topic please subscribe keep safety equipment q airbags really work preliminary statistic suggest follow airbags work much better belt good point belt alone work much better airbags alone airbags point belt work slightly better point belt alone con airbags design tend burn driver hand vent byproduct explosion occur inside bag design may knock driver hand wheel make retention control vehicle bag deflate difficult brake question q always need get rotor disk brake turn midas always want specific condition mandate turn replace rotor shop try make little extra money replace rotor often strictly necessary rotor warp warp lightly groove need replace turn note also rotor rotor many hondas good example narrow begin practical turn must replace become thin warp badly groove q tell downshift brake slow car really good idea use good idea back day mediocre fade prone drum brake modern disc brake equip car use downshifting slow car really necessary except case long steep downhill run otherwise modern disc brake adequate stop passenger car circumstance much cheaper repair clutch line hand many standard driver license test usa still specify driver test downshift brake suggest take u driver test either learn smoothly take time practice borrow car automatic take test q often replace brake fluid probably often traditional brake fluid tend absorb water water corrode internal part brake system also lower boil point fluid type older fluid newer specification principal difference wet dry boil point dry boil point important fresh brake fluid wet boil point important older brake fluid fluid lowest wet dry boil point requirement fluid better boil point requirement fluid best boil point requirement fluid clearly superior see next q detail requirement imply fluid better fluid may specific case fluid preferable mostly competition application otherwise type fluid offer much improve brake pedal feel replacement year recommend fluid although agressive driver may profit change fluid frequently least bleed modest amount fluid brake caliper fairly regularly q brake fluid break two part specification look excellent performance first fluid silicone base silicone fluid tricky proposition unlike fluid absorb water may sound like feature problem water present pool system interfere brake performance corrode metal spot pool occur water tend migrate downwards brake system brake caliper corrosion occur phenomenon essential convert silicone empty entire brake system flush throughly beforehand even recommend replace rubber part brake system convert silicone fluid two issue come silicone fluid difficult pour cleanly without air bubble interfere get good brake pedal feel generally much higher boil point fluid high temperature failure mode indistinguishable effect boil fluid silicone fluid may make sense street car application certainly recommend high performance drive application economics questionable street use recently become aware new fluid meet standard contain silicone fluid appear reasonably compatible older fluid little information time q ab available car look cost worth doe cut dry answer therefore answer quite long order cover pro con short answer ab cost initially maintain generally work better average driver say driver doe extensive experience high performance drive technique may require unlearn obsolete brake technique like pump brake unlearn case long answer ab work monitering wheel car look sign lock brake may may able able distinguish

help maybe maybe car knock sensor adjust engine time turbocharger boost suit gasoline use car however use cheapest gas make car run well check owner manual detail car need q car wa make lead gasoline unleaded gas hurt possible unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although amoco oil company argue otherwise actual increase valve wear almost unnoticeable however modern lead gasoline actually contain little lead however check owner manual many car early actually require lead gasoline q fuel treatment help kind use winter good idea use dry gas however may harmful fuel injection system never use additive contain methanol sometimes call methyl alcohol additive may damage fuel system car carbs almost certainly damage car fuel injection manufacturer opinion vary additive contain ethanol sometimes call ethyl alcohol car ha fuel injection check owner manual car use manufacturer consider ethanol acceptable gasoline additive isopropyl alcohol isopropanol petroleum distillate fine fuel inject car occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful car fuel injector although many premium gasoline contain detergent job brand fuel injector cleaner contain ethanol methanol always check ingredient put anything gas tank small number particularly good additive noticeably expensive run-of-the-mill one work much much better among chevron techron redline wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber bg bottle one every six month highly recommend q detergent gasoline quality detergent package gasoline vary somewhat bmw ha institute test program gasoline brand pas test may advertise fact sticker indicate passage test begin appear fuel pump gas station gasoline use fuel injector cleaner probably optional beforewarned use bmw approve gasoline keep clean engine clean may clean motor bad valve deposit lubrication question q number letter motor oil designation mean several different item encode two-letter code indicate type detergent package manufacturer us oil look like se sf cd code gasoline engine application c code diesel engine application second letter assign sequence new level protection develop thus sf consider better se se consider better sd forth noticeable designation oil weight either single number weight pair number separate letter w latter type much commonly use day type automobile manufacturer specify operator manual first number designation apparent viscosity oil cold w stand winter second number viscosity oil hot trick oil doe actually get thicker turn weight weight get hotter actually happen oil cold ha viscosity cold weight oil get hotter doe get thin fast oil would time temperature ha viscosity hot weight oil note number actually specify range viscosity oil exactly viscosity cold weight oil viscosity hot note also novel behaviour multi-grade oil cause additive ha report sole exception castrol gtx oil retain multi-grade characteristic well time oil work well though q quick lube place good adequate work quite incompetent one let buyer beware watch work make sure overtorque oil drain plug keep hand wallet time q oil additive like tufoil good tufoil ptfe-based additive many come onto market recently different moly-based additive around since early ptfe chemical name teflon tm trademark dupont general auto manufacturer recommend use product usenet response question additive favorable slight increase mpg application smoother rev long term result whether ptfe additive effective mile debatable manufacturer saab claim either product engine flush preceeds application cause deterioration oil seal eventual leakage bmw owner report death valve seal shortly addition slick car writer ha caution dealer use japanese motor may clog oil return passage engine otherwise know report damage cause ptfe additive hand satified slick customer world q synthetic oil really work yes specifically auto manufactuers accept synthetic disagree extremely long oil change interval claim oil manufacturer auto manufacturer recommend continue change oil interval recommend owner manual car even decide try longer interval least change oil filter regular interval synthetic get dirty conventional oil synthetic gear lubricant manual transmission another matter entirely amsoil redline agip highly regard effective mobil synthetic gear lube get mix review however q manufacturer specify longer longer oil change interval often change oil depend drive car always nearly always get warm drive hard keep rev manufacturer recommendation probably fine however drive hard drive high rev alternatively drive supermarket doe get temperature may wish change oil much often perhaps mile interval give manufacturer specify mile interval drive car much say mile year probably want change oil every six month anyway store car winter change oil store change oil bring storage misc question q car ha time belt hear bad thing happen break story depend internal design motor early ford escort example suffer severe valve damage belt break newer car require tow installation new belt honda motor damage others replacement interval specify car change belt least every mile car may require frequent replacement ask dealer independent mechanic also ask relate repair take place time example ford escort suffer valve damage also time belt drive water pump ha know seize destroy time belt cause major valve damage side effect replace time belt ignore water pump costly mistake q would anyone stupid enough design motor self destruct time belt break performance reason compromise piston design valve piston collide require compression ratio engine reduce significantly likely avoid valve damage economy car performance orient vehicle q cause unintended acceleration final report national highway transportation safety administration conclude unintended acceleration could cause mechanical failure vehicle question time consistent physical evidence nhtsa report go conclude pedal misapplication vehicle operator probably cause richard welty welty nothing good ha ever report full rotation race car either pitch roll axis carroll smith
