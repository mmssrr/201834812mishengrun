document window enhance mode floppy-controller-based tape backup device sound card miscellaneous info please note part document contain technical sometimes terse description problem reference adaptec technical support adaptec bb please send comment correction etc via email compuserve internet darrylo window enhance mode window install program automatically configure window use adaptec however case something go wrong go describe change need get window work also may notice instal window make pc run much slower even run window method speed discuss section call window run slowly msdos configuration window install program add smartdrive disk cache file follow instruction notice need use double-buffering smartdrive default setup also notice system run much much slower window msdos see section call window run slowly way speed system window configuration get adaptec work window make sure section file contain entry believe window install program automatically add entry sure doe work might want try add line probably need line though systemrombreakpoint entry use enable support memory manager like need use program window run slowly get window run chance system run much slower probably happen use version file congratulation appear win solution lucky whether luck hold remain see system run much slower almost definitely cause smartdrive double-buffering accord window documentation microsoft technical note smartdrive double buffer require must use smartdrive double-buffering enable work really slow pc estimate slow pc factor five consider unacceptable look solution unfortunately disable double-buffering window enhance mode work might even destroy content hard disk try run window one follow use driver provide double-buffering opinion unbelievable slowness smartdrive cause either horribly inefficient double-buffering bug smartdrive use driver provide vd service vd stand virtual dma service standard support window allow bus-mastering disk controller like work window trash hard disk countless time find follow solution none require use smartdrive note however get occasional parity error probably cause solution might see follow doe require smartdrive use kind disk cache utility strongly recommend make window run much much faster driver need aspi function control cdrom tape drive two physical hard disk etc add driver file window need option driver must load low memory load high memory occupy november driver could obtain adaptec bb hopefully still need aspi function driver version use driver file amazingly enough driver also load high assume would think would crash system doe ask adaptec technical support say load high fine long load low system use would occasionally cause window crash upon restart exit window additional result corrupt disk c file would corrupt crash usually occur make different program default window shell vice-versa reason may necessary absolutely idea necessary version earlier note many people use without seem problem consider people lucky others like sort problem opinion best necessarily easiest solution upgrade driver longer need unfortunately could get previous upgrade adaptec bb driver available adaptec bb far know three way get copy buy new november adaptec ez scsi driver kit supposedly include well driver cdrom driver believe list price around already copy older version supposedly contact adaptec upgrade ez scsi around copy include central point pc tool msdos note documentation driver store different directory note include cdrom driver driver support two hard disk include obtain copy note however get occasional parity error window probability defective hardware pc cause upgrade motherboard find solution however parity error occur disk access small definite possibility parity error driver-related example change bus time certain disk transfer might cause run various memory test hour time test find problem problem probably cause memory marginal time requirement cause parity error disk transfer memory test find problem problem show disk however mention case hardware problem floppy-controller-based tape backup device two possible problem use adaptec floppy-controller-based tape backup device colorado memory system jumbo tape take long time tape drive constantly start stop start stop etc tape operation may erratic encounter many tape error problem might cause defective hardware however hear people similar problem mention case hardware problem tape take long time floppy-controller-based tape backup device may adjust adaptec bus time best result use tape drive normally tape backup restore tape drive motor continuously run occasional pause however default bus time adaptec may cause tape drive motor start stop start stop every second cause needle wear tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause make sure tape head clean also cause tape backup restore take much much longer necessary problem tape backup use floppy dma transfer data memory tape drive adaptec us dma transfer data memory hard disk floppy dma need fee data tape drive certain rate tape drive feed data quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stop rewinds bite restart enough data eventually feed default bus time adaptec really dma time large example backup data ha transfer hard disk memory memory tape default time adaptec hog memory much much time spend transfer data hard disk memory enough time spend transfer data memory tape drive result tape drive constantly start stop data feed quickly enough solution change adaptec bus time default factory set microsecond microsecond bus time need lower microsecond one two way use n option example use bus time microsecond mean use follow line file note space n recourse try find program call difficult find reason adaptec reason doe seem want widely distribute ask someone work adaptec ask upload anywhere anonymous ftp access internet could try use archie hunt copy believe couple site find copy run like setscsi adjust bus time microsecond run without argument reset bus time back factory default note seem use use crash system wa load could use however lower bus time microsecond increase microsecond lower low hard disk throughput suddenly drop system feel slower microsecond work fine value may work fine may adjust downwards little lower bus time tape backup restore run faster also experiment bus time option intentionally describe unless know bad combination cause parity error worse starve memory refresh program call exist adaptec bb unless ha upgrade since last check ha self-extracting archive contain batch file couple file batch file wa suppose allow one set bus time others however try run program system crash time wa run check see wa conflict maybe old program work although doc say work erratic tape operation many tape error problem may may exist although exist system hardware problem particular could cause however hear people similar problem mention case hardware problem symptom problem persist even clean tape head back tape encounter unusable sector detect error result abort tape backup tape backup work tape compare fail tape drive start stop start stop etc much often unlike above-mentioned problem tape take long time tape drive start stop every second kind occur every second fastback plus doe tape backup device program like central point backup cm jumbo software assume cm jumbo tape drive tape drive fastback plus many tape read error although know cause problem discover use different floppy controller solve month ago upgrade motherboard contain integrate floppy controller already floppy controller initially disable motherboard floppy controller decide try disable floppy controller use one motherboard tape drive cm jumbo reliability increase dramatically fastback plus wa suddenly able find use tape drive know wa cause hardware problem one hand floppy drive work great attach seem say wa nothing wrong hand tape drive work well attach floppy controller work attach different controller could indication hardware problem change floppy drive cable conceivable problem wa cable know cause really however similar problem might want consider try new floppy controller sound card many popular sound card play record digitize sound typically use dma like tape drive dma adaptec dma conflict sound card dma unlike tape dma conflict usually manifest parity error system crash parity error message happen data transfer quickly sound card adaptec memory refresh occur quickly enough cause parity error usually get parity error mean hardware problem system case however parity error symptom bad hardware find parity error typically occur record digitize sound chance error increase increase record fidelity higher sample rate record stereo record use instead etc like tape drive solution solution lower adaptec bus time see section tape drive information note however may may solve problem may reduce probability parity error software use record digitize sound greatly affect problem software inefficient disk cache speed hard disk amount disk fragmentation also affect miscellaneous info section contain miscellaneous hint tip rumor much merely information hear read verify believe follow information correct sure use risk qemm need specify db parameter unless use driver qemm bootup although qemm manual mention install program doe seem detect present automatically add option qemm command line least occur qemm install program test version earlier version qemm probably need parameter sure never use version earlier use need give qemm db parameter version support hard disk one gigabyte size support hard disk capacity need get new rom bios adaptec sure still true latest sell adaptec connect cdrom drive need scsi cdrom drive driver note cdrom drive proprietary interface non-scsi drive use three choice cdrom driver idea well follow solution work even work follow secondhand information buy adaptec ez scsi driver package list something like already older adaptec driver supposedly upgrade ez scsi around contact adaptec detail ez scsi package supposedly contain everything need buy corelscsi driver package make people make coreldraw package contain cdrom driver scsi tape driver worm driver etc know list price see package sell around note corelscsi doe come driver need already may better get adaptec ez scsi instead method obsolete follow driver obsoleted adaptec ez scsi kit mention case someone already ha driver use driver adaptec kit kit aspi cdrom driver get copy high-level cdrom driver include kit available several bulletin board use scsi tape drive need software know talk scsi tape drive software hear like section cdrom drive idea well follow solution work even work follow secondhand information central point pc tool msdos supposedly support large number scsi tape drive come scsi driver well central point backup corelscsi driver package contain scsi tape backup program see section cdrom drive detail however note corelscsi doe come require see advertisement sell three configuration scsi controller hard disk rom bios scsi controller adaptec aspi driver scsi controller adaptec aspi driver corelscsi imagine adaptec sell fourth configuration scsi controller ez scsi driver include aspi driver people use unix might interest version gnu tar msdos talk scsi tape drive via driver need driver use program never use version gnu tar hear work know well though anonymous ftp access internet copy find mirror site gnu tar scsi tape drive adaptec patch aspibin relative gnu tar src gnu tar scsi tape adaptec ctrlr idea copy find compuserve unixforum might forum doe far msdos concern controller msdos work well however hardware two board identical least one non-msdos program initially work work version bsd unix case anyone curious edit copy file ram rom st umb shell c p note use qemm use probably use look like ram rom st umb shell c p use probably use something look like ram rom st umb shell c p however use floppy-controller-based tape drive plan record high-quality sound sound card would still need way change adaptec bus time first two version take care last version doe local variable fill-column eval
