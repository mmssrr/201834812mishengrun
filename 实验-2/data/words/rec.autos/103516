petebre brent peterson subject drag coefficient article gwm gary w mahan write could someone explain make sense drag coefficient cd mention magazine understand lower number signify better aerodynamics doe mean real world way calculate new top speed assume car rev limit top speed mileage benefit identical car cd reduce remember formula hand ha awhile since take aerodynamics use stuff since cd relate drag force effect top speed fuel consumption drag force car aircraft greater vehicle engine overcome ha reach top speed auto course also overcome roll resistance since drag oppose vehicle motion engine must make burn fuel anyway since geometery auto rather complex drag pressure coeffiecent etc either find experimentaly use numerical method anyway flow around cylinder drag coeff cd drag force q flow velocity r radius clyinder get rough rough estimate set r car width q car speed know cd find drag force car would need overcome bp
