jeff jeff gruszynski subject digital voltmeter doe work mamishev alexander valentino write hello let introduce problem measure sinusoidal wave voltage digital voltmeter use ac mode output rms value peak value square right measure square wave mode ac output equal peak value actually upper flat boundary wave assume digital voltmeter make kind integration input value divide wave period right use measure square wave distort high-frequency harmonic ideally output output value wa previous one nature output value doe voltmeter actually measure doe show rms read unless dvm say measure rms probably average voltage input diode rectify measure dc say rms measure incorrectly measure average multipling correction true sine wave vave vrms want correct rms waveform need true-rms literally doe root-mean-square calculation either analog digital circuitry relate question le important advantage disadvantage digital voltmeter compare analog one last significant advantage analog imo wa able see signal wa change time check electrolytic capacitor anymore dmm bargraphs etc duplicate thank attention could mail opinion open discussion would appreciate either way alexander v mamishev power system automation laboratory phone office department electrical engineer phone home texas university fax college station tx usa internet jeff gruszynski semiconductor test equipment system engineer hewlett-packard jeff jeff
