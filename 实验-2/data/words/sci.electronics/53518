kolstad joel kolstad subject dumb question function generator article david glen jacobowitz write new scope think save buck buy one function generator build hmm wa ad combination crank saw function generator ha offset amplitude high way could make little box could solve little problem box would tkae function generator input lower voltage give output impedance low unchanging number would want lower voltage factor one hundred could build little buffer amp like box active sure already get right idea ignore ohm internal resistance generator second run say voltage divider make ohm series ohm new circuit thevenin equivalent one put original voltage ha output impedence negligibly le ohm may want monkey value little depend whether care exact divide ratio availability part hows sound joel kolstad high voltage probe multimeters accurate still cheap something like meg series doe load often high impedence source much well keep probably meg impedance multimeter happy
