jackb jack brindle subject radio freq use measure distance article tgg tom gardner write robert g carpenter write wonder possible use radio wave measure distance transmitter receiver yes call radar well actually quite radar radio-altimeters measure distance measure time require transmit signal receive reflection target radar generally us pulse radio altimeter use either pulse modulate continuous-wave transmission case latter highly accurate distance measurement make example original bendix radio altimeter wa accurate foot foot altitude note however different method measure poster originally ask problem gain accurate measurement transmitter seperate receiver need highly accurate time base start receiver exact instant transmitter trigger wire connect since radio wave actually travel faster free-space air case wire difference call velocity factor cable need resort common timebase automatically correct distance etc something like pll connect gps receiver trick trigger transmitter receiver simultaneously sound expensive bad plan spend buck equipment effort go different method surveyor use laser-light system reflection time measure try sound like something know anyway seem able measure signal strength determine distance would short distance ft would need accuracy inch actually highly inaccurate since power output transmitter vary unit unit variance antenna transmission line receiver may also vary unit unit unit time would need continuously calibrate entire system radio altimeter also since everything locate one place much easier note especially time base receiver transmitter one unit also depend environment static environent waveguide yes dynamic environment object move multipath kill concept nope fm capture effect say strongest signal win unless two interfere signal seperated db signal strength one problem make altimeter inaccurate low altitude signal bounce runway tend strong frequency would best doe matter high possible eliminate outside influence also enhance attenuation multipath signal radio altimeter typically use frequency around ghz hope help jack brindle ham radio internet jackb
