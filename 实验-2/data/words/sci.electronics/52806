paj paul johnson subject peltier effect heat pump wa look couple component catalogue come across range peltier effect heat pump intend cool component hear effect put current one device pump heat one side reverse current reverse effect think temperature difference give emf well anyway strike could make nice box picnic one power regulator thermostat couple heat sink biggest device shift efficiency ai bad although would flatten car battery half hour unfortunately catalogue list anything basic spec heat pump imagine would get back-emf temperature gradient across device increase presumably power decrease back-emf increase eventually steady state current consume assume leakage final temperature difference two side could set supply voltage nothing although would lousy way control would like know guess correct open-circuit thermal resistance typical device want sure coolbox go get warm fast unplug doe peltier effect heat pump actually work look like magic use thing domestic thank advance paul paul johnson paj tel ext idea others like gec-marconi research reputable idealist responsible opinion
