mpaul marxhausen paul subject kill ac inductive load spike fast dirty way kill line spike occur inductive load turn sometime zero-crossing ac cycle capacitor kludged somehow etc get microcontroller run bunch valve pump big instrument washer almost everything switch zero-crossing solid state relay stuff stay quiet ac-wise one steam valve get turn mechanical relay water tank system control ssrs doe sometimes spike reset one peripheral chip software time try love tack magic spike-killing fix would avoid major varistor would help might sufficient idea paul marxhausen university nebraska lincoln grace happen
