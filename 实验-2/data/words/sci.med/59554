infection concern vitamin vitamin wa originally discover wa commonly refer anti-infection vitamin many people linus pauling one decide take title away vitamin give vitamin c already cover big mistake opinion vitamin also get reputation anti-cancer vitamin good reason nci currently ha numerous clinical trial progress see vitamin prevent cancer cure well role cancer infection almost identical quite vitamin come two completely different form retinol beta-carotene retinol animal form toxic beta-carotene plant form completely nontoxic retinol beta carotene display good absorption human gut bile

nutritional reserve like retinol liver important low vitamin reserve go affect believe like nutrient reserve important problem vitamin rda vitamin adult male vitamin adult feamles vitamin diet survey show american get amount vitamin either retinol beta-carotene diet nrc national research council wa go release new rda table rda vitamin vitamin c raise c per day per day adult male report recommendation wa kill concern increase supplementation wa main reason rdas set prevent clinical disease keep nutrient reserve full many scientist feel time ha come move away prevention clinical pathology concept move towards promotion optimum health concept especially since good data show nutrient reserve extremely important period stress nutritonal concervatives win battle new group scientist collect come rda list lower rda several nutrient move dietary guideline back first start get enough prevent clinical pathology enough fill reserve know autopsy american liver normal vitamin reserve preach nutrient reserve student tell measure patient vitamin liver biopsy autopsy data tell much somebody ha store tell easily someone ha overfill liver vitamin measure serium retinol level
