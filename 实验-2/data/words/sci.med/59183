effluent human kind different organism live gi system mouth stomach small large intestine sinus vagina skin nonpathogenic cause disease people unless immune system compromise also call nonpathogens unlike pathogenic organism cause human disease produce toxin live merry existence body organism consider pathogenic manage take residence within body poor mucus membrane barrier let happen vitamin mainly responsible set barrier well-described situation prior post definitely wa immune stress blood test show vitamin level low sinus mess doubt mucosal line cilium heavily damage also wa antibiotic time year end even two week ceftin work confirm diagnosis chronic bacterial infection sinus via cat-scans mucus color wo get detail symptom three traditional ent make diagnosis culture however difficulty right symptom clearly show bacterial infection enough background provide help understand wa make comment sporanox anti-fungal therapy first question fungus penetrate little way poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hypha thus cause symptom without consider classic sense sort inbetween infection steve get real upset elaine doctor wa use anti-fungals vitamin gi problem steve really understoood vitamin doe body would least call elaine doctor quack wa concern toxicity vitamin doctor blood test put iu vitamin one week drop iu next couple week also receive zinc supplementation since interrelate fairly complex way doctor explain one orthomolecular specialist blood test three week later vitamin wa normal stop vitamin except multi-vitamin supplement make sure maintain beta carotene call carrot face hopefully elaine doctor take similar careful approach supplement even reevaluate supplement take example niacin fairly large dosage steve dyer good information niacin ha second-order improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergy probably worth take large dose long-term risk liver damage survive get access lot glucose bloom ride organism live sinus gi tract vagina though believe base successful therapy sporanox definitely excessive growth fungus unknown specie sinus still want ask question study demonstrate candida bloom sinus associate sinus irritation sinus irritation reduce significantly one week sporanox new treatment implement time noticeable gi track problem start sporanox day go away consider normal btw doctor dig one medical reference book sorry ca remember one find obscure comment date back state people develop contain non-lethal non-serious aspergillis infestation aspergiliosis sinus lead sinus inflammation symptom dig reference since relevant discussion people really develop bad inflammatory process mucus membrane skin bloom site whether allergic like reaction candida certain doctor test believe rast rast similar test allergic response specificially candida albicans show strong positive another question would everybody show strong positive test essentially useless assume true candida grow part-way mucus membrane tissue concentration exceed threshold amount could person test allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptom mucus membrane irritation due body allergic response say earlier post one doe need rocket scientist degree biochemistry see plausibility hypothesis btw repost dr ivker book sinus survival ha routinely give anything else nizoral pre-sporanox systemic anti-fungal safe good sporanox new chronic sinusitis patient antibiotic four time last two year claim patient well notice relief sinus inflammation symptom doe cure mean imply so-called infection primary cause later complication also find nystatin whether take internally put sinus spray doe help imply course assume excessive bloom aggravate sinus inflammation ha grow partway tissue since nystatin kill direct contact absorb blood stream admit lot doe please hard-core nt ha double-blind study non-issue one ha start plausible strawman internal symptom use symptom pretty nondescript bring interest observation use deny reject aspect hypothesis appropriate study ca observe culture yeast bloom gut sinus way diagnose even recognize disease know realize virtually impossible test candida overbloom part body easily observe since candida everywhere body real another totally reject hypothesis say study actually study certain standard perspective non-study even consider agree appropriate study take big right however order convince fund agency austere time open wallet literally give evidence acceptable evidence compete proposal paradoxically almost exact study need fund study even get fund scientist national lab aware smaller fund project afraid even dr ivker doctor get together pool practice case history anecdote compel picture approach fund agency would get nowhere even able publish statistical result obvious comment doctor decide excessive yeast colonization gut sinus lead noticeable non-lethal symptom doe exist even tenable hypothesis amount case history compile anecdotal evidence contrary never change mind would also oppose need study mind issue excessive yeast growth lead diffuse allergic symptom doe exist period kind tough dialog hold viewpoint kind remind lister candida keep check people normal bacterial flora sinus gi tract mouth stomach intestine vaginal tract compete food human immune system ususally doe bother nonpathogenic organism unless broach mucus membrane barrier inflammatory response set american get enough vitamin diet american die le vitamin bear autopsy study low level vitamin doe cause pathology blindness doe impair mucus membrane barrier system would predispose factor strong inflammatory response candida bloom also nutrient necessary proper work sinus mucus membrane cilium diabetic suffer candida bloom common cause type bloom use broad spectrum antibiotic knock many different kind bacteria body remove main competition candida far food concern drug available handle candida many patient find doctor use unless evidence systemic infection toxicity anti-fungal drug doe warrant caution gi sinus inflammation suspect candida recent use broad spectrum antibiotic smoke gun anti-fungal use approrpriate anti-fungal cream appropriate treatment recur vaginal yeast infection spite mr steve dyer say evidence mycological study indicate many specie grow hypha root deep tissue similar mold grow bread continue kill surface nystatin doe ca kill deeper tissue without use systemic anti-fungal itraconazole sporanox older one nizoral toxic effective ha point recent study send doctor e-mail contact thank nystatin effective long term treatment gi tract candidiasis like try weed garden cut grind leave root ready come walk away question whether contain candida bloom partially grow tissue mucus membrane cause type symptom susceptible people allergy without become systemic classical sense word something strictly excessive bloom cause problem full-blown systemic infection potentially lethal gi system ano-rectal region seem particularly good reservoir candida use pantyhose many woman create favorable environment around rectum transfer moisture humidity candida vaginal tract one effctive way minimmize transfer wear undyed cotton underwear also one retentive like diagnose prior post also provide site excessive candida growth bloom occur anal area burn swell pain even blood discharge make many patient think hemorroids bloom manage move gi tract diffuse symptomatology occur abdominal discomfort blood stool positive stool occult blood send elaine family doctor first place extensive test tell wa nothing wrong gut still hurt another doctor richard kaplan ha tell throiugh e-mail consider occult blood test stool specimen waste time money large number false positive candida bloom guy gut hurt constant basis would want fix yes nice know colon cancer cause distress finally find doctor treat get better steve dyer call quack say private e-mail flaw current medical system make difficult even impossible physician attempt alternative therapy therapy work example go three ent say live sinusitis ab fail mention surgery open ostia ostia plug would get root cause condition three month aggressive fairly non-standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitor equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc health ha vastly improve wa two year ago health greatly deteriorate course skeptic would say maybe nothing would improve anyway view stretch thing quite far experience three ent saw say live confident reach one could call total cure anti-fungal program undertake wa one necessary step direction overuse ab last four year note sinus problem may suggest book dr ivker mention sure get revise edition often wonder chronic gi distress sinus problem would problem tell patient non-existent syndrome dr ivker start chronic severe sinus problem visit several ent totally floor say live spend several year try everything standard non-standard wa essentially cure chronic sinusitis share approach book honestly say road recovery follow part one recommendation take systemic anti-fungal begin treatment history anti-biotic overuse ha prove time time practice sure comment hard-core belief anti yeast hypothesis poster would definite thing say work wonder almost two thousand case put mildly also would surprise would say one violate moral obligation help patient maybe doctor read practice confront patient symptom could due hypothetical yeast overgrowth fit profile pro-yeast people identify consider anti-fungal therapy avenue exhaust remember theory practice two different thing one without synergistic doctor doe something non-standard yet produce noticeable symptomatic relief thousand patient least sit take notice maybe ought trust say begin hypothesize work instead work afraid lot doctor become enamor scientific correctness ignore patient swear help balance see poster group come point use little common sense maybe empirical approach try good systemic anti-fungal sporanox exhaust avenue wa one traditional medical establishment wa able help natural thing go couple doctor somewhat outside establishment result find significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sue license pull try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapy patient finally reach point accept therapy ineffective like hear doctor tell well try therapy approve accept country since clearly work authority use experimental unproven technique seem help others ca promise anything risk sign something say understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapy register case state board anyway ent suggest would jump pronto instead go one doctor either altruistic reason greed practice alternative therapy much risk risk mean lose license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable data would essentially free also would morally ethically better current system show compassion medical community patient everything within reason help patient lack mechanism lead large number people try alternative therapy seem work like case others never work true quackery better get soapbox post reach size take orally also become major bacteria gut aresol spray ha also use innoculate sinus membrane innoculation occur mucus membrane barrier system need strengthen accomplish vitamin vitamin c b-complex vitamin diet survey repeatedly show american get enough folate probably segement population greatest problem non-existent disorder candida bloom antibiotic therapy dosage appear necessary promote heal proper work mucos memebranes material wa obtain natural heal mark bricklin publish rodale press well note human nutrition course post discussion vitamin sometime future along reference cite point extremely important role vitamin play mucus membrane defense system body vitamin effective deal candida bloom another effective dietary treatment restrict carbohydrate intake treatment phase especially important gi system involve candida get glucose go grow bacteria give bacteria use amino acid fatty acid energy chance take keep candida check carbohydrate return gut like see role complex carbohydrate starch steve nay-sayers want jump post fine jump steve sci med nutrition verbably accost poster wa seek advice doctor use vitamin anti-fungals candida bloom gut people seek advice newsnet treat way u give time knowledge slug heart content save venom steve leave helpless poster timidly seek help alone would problem behavior brave soul venom usenet quite toxic unless one develop immunity
