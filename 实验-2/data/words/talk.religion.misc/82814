daveb dave butler subject new biblical contradiction still answer juda mr decenso spite require scholarly opinion hang juda reject scholarly opinion scholar rephrase scholar opinion subject know matthew hang act probably record death although possible plausible fell hang hit rock thereby burst open longer assume case therefore contradiction matthew say juda die result hang scholar believe iprobably quote show highly regard scholar explanation look text initially ca assume juda die however highly probable also nothing greek suggest success failure simply mean hang oneself actually research greek word apacgw find doe denote success scholar indeed excellent reason assume suicide wa successful point recently check several lexicon greek english lexicon new testament louw nida robinson greek english lexicon new testament greek english lexicon new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale greek english lexicon new testament early christian write bauer-arndt-gingrich new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher couple simply state hang oneself couple explicit state apacgw mean specifically kill hang couple also note mean one root word apacgw strangle throttle choke pretty much invalidate guy suggest david joslin juda wa hang upside one best reference though robinson greek english lexicon new testament state translation give root word literal translation relate greek word use root also present specific example word greek literature give context word apagchw ha two root word gchw strangle root root word apo mean literally away root word include word denote transition mean transition place eg greek word apagello mean send message apo also denote change state specifically change life death robinson specifically make comparison word apokteiuo mean kill literal mean word apacgw mean throttle strangle put way implicitly denote change life state ie away life death word apacgw doe mean hang specifically denote death well thus robinson quite specific state mean hang oneself end one life hang note use apacgw homer odessy denote context present example apacgw use explicitly mean suicide hang since perfectly good word strangle without add denotation death insist bible wa write god every word precicely correct stick complete mean apacgw ie since word apacgw wa use death denote result way note mr decenso also present example apacgw septuagint greek translation ot use time jesus use samuel ahithophel saw advice wa follow saddle donkey arise go home house city put household order hang die wa bury father tomb notice state ahithophel hang gr sept apagcho explicitly add die doubt result matthew explicitly tell juda die note mr decenso say septuagint wa translation hebrew greek show original mean hebrew ie hebrew say die thus whether wa simply echo greek also point regardless add die correct translation would still apacgw man indeed die strangulation redundant correct evidence septuagint wa repeatedly rewrite reedited include version contradict edit wa even necessarily execute greek thus sure use septuagint stand paragon ancient greek really need prove point mr decenso example ancient greek someone commit apacgw survive otherwise would see simply make worthless assertion without correspond evidence would note mr decenso everytime go way research one apparently contrive exegisis pretty much find false thus think go add text something source clearly say better explicit greek historical source justify way mr rise statement tree around potter field still tree around ledge rocky pavement bottom unless mr rise show tree two thousand year old year old stump ha thousand year old description area mention tree inappropriate assert present placement tree prove location tree two thousand year ago thing change argument ie money juda use silver second question mr decenso ask could sure money juda purchase land wa indeed betrayal rather source would point act specifically mention reward iniquity act also specifically mention act iniquity talk ie act concern juda wa guide arrest jesus would point bible describe act iniquity immediately discus reward iniquity would rather inane suggest wa action iniquity one discuss notice verse word iniquity use rather state juda become guide arrest jesus writer stop v wa number u obtain part ministry part juda play ministry true peter author act doe specifically call juda betrayal iniquity matter neither doe john specifically call juda action iniquity either john say juda take money box rather say think juda money box jesus wa tell buy need feast give something poor receive morsel immediately go wa night note say juda leave doe say take money box thus see explanation still seem would choose unproven iniquity mention another author different book write different time iniquity explicitly mention author act find force contrive course particular argument become moot since see evidence apacgw mean suicide see since juda hang wa successful could spend money mention john matthew mark explicitly say betrayal wa high holy day ie passover thus could spend money kill next day thus money buy field blood would piece silver course get piece silver night well thus could spend either oh dear believe house card comming maybe point discus whether jesus wa crucify friday saturday part argument juda way prophesy potter field come ie mention matthew say please study death remind discus remind discus part verse discuss wish would quit procrastinate sidestep issue later dave butler wise man proportion belief evidence david hume philosopher inquiry concern human understand p would note state bible possibly inerrant state inerrant since admission present merely possible reconciliation course rate highly best say bible possibly inerrant inerrant
