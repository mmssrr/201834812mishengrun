subject eck v rickey wa rickey whine smith brian smith article genetic david tate write read followup think go back original article make specific comment method jao john oswalt say ha obtain play play record computer readable form every major league baseball game past several year devise algorithm call sum-over-situations write computer program calculate every major league player contribution use work like look every situation every game baseball season situation determine inning score baserunners many situation count many time team eventually win game situation occur divide number time situation come come value situation wa first george lindsey late report article investigation strategy baseball author george r lindsey journal operation research issue volume july-august pp later pete palmer thing use simulate season generate larger set data avoid kind small-sample anomaly people worry report john thorn gary skoog modify method bite work call value add measure base situational value base directly marginal run though win probability result apply season report one bill jam baseball abstract book help somebody example situation might inning score runner second regular season major league game last year rockies marlin year say situation come team ahead win value situation description method look change win probability base bat plus baserunning player amount time get plate appearance player sum at-bat base-running value season obtain overall value player obviously sum player value game season whole always credit x batter x pitcher validation involve ok big problem nobody ha yet comment add probability probability add run add total team run break many run joe contribute plus many run fred contribute etc probability work way bob increase team chance win pa doe mean bob increase team chance win fact doe mean anything unit screwy agree disagree john say batter effort result win loss probably correct doe mean win loss mean something would rather player increase team chance win pa would player increase chance win pa thus appear obvious positive association john statistic win game thus disregard stat appear study must go sort relationship consider example bob hit solo hr bottom first scale doe thing fourth score tie another seventh score tie another finally ninth win game score value bob hit solo hr plate appearance wa credit method doe mean wa bob responsible win certainly defense always responsible include pitch bob wa pitch fact bob wa offense lot even close furthermore team run say come solo hr fred fred wa hit hr tie game valuable hr take lead see lindsey fred accrue good rat fred bob combine amass win one game clearly problem problem insistance number mean exactly many win team ha first use average many season apply one game second remember player performance take away chance win player get get negative probability case thus sure give game add number team win add game sometimes add one sometime le one also pitcher bad performance give run may give large negative percentage game also batter pull night would give large negative greg think right thing intuition mark closer enormously important total number run value outweigh come prevent comming double greg allow enough another article propose test predict team record quite accurately look many run total score allow without regard run score game late run really important early run look late run lead better predictor right really smaller sample size would think however number run score first inning would good prediction many run score last inning realize something else closer usually come close situation blow hard argue run closer give game equal importance give first inning look closer give run often mean team lose many game hand starter give run often still leaf team chance win offence ha many something say late inning situation equally important either run ninth really doe matter many run pitcher give ninth another think experiment apply method basketball find point score first half game almost exactly value lead safe entire half yet play furthermore sub bench sink win free throw time clock get game star forward score point first half sprain ankle get zero doe make sense would assume team probability win would possesion free throw make look point second leave fairly high probability win game possesion ball forget somebody el miss shoot turnover foul bad defense etc cause negative chance team would win read discussion statistic feel critisize certain extent agenda first look statistic valadates clutchness really doe cluthness revolve around idea certain player crucial situation elevate performance others performance go never see convince proof really happen assume clutchness mean except lot noice statistic ha positive association player performance way get rid noice believe clutchness certainly could find average value home run example may find instance home run increase chance win average strikeout decrease chance win bet would find statistic wa good statistic predict win loss evaluate relief pitcher say john sam exact pitch statistic run earn run k bb etc exceptional number john however pitch closer situation sam wa mop man wa valuble team probably john wa better pitcher probably brian smith
