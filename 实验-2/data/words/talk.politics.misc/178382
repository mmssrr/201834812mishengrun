question whether constitution might write appeal principle rather appear believe wa write something else mind propoganda put supporter let honest something wa last time bring valid point argument simply propogranda ca know phill really mean obviously use argument design convince well know hamilton wa dye wool monarchist probably authoritarian extreme jefferson democratic impules would suggest mean determine opinion government consider write government propose mean exist determine true opinion thus true opinion die little help today opinion slightest bear matter though argument true false regardless say true false regardles say earth make point call propogranda would seem irrelevent difficulty u poster seem consider argument may flaw longer apply modern society oh argument question believe longer apply think good argument entirely happy situation obviously apply minority time think alone sufficient invalidate alive today one opinion could count upon men express careful study mechanism government necessary ongoing improvement require give opinion certain area prove right area get wrong ensure wa mechanism adapt improve consititution happen willingness accept structural problem within u political system may require constitutional change solution since constitution basis political system change would require constitutional change particular case however fillibuster matter procedure tradition make part constitution senate wa le powerful house lord almost state house representative wa also fact british government much greater power american system principle practice yes principle le power le power british government today theoreticaly dependent monarch convention monarch seek exercise power depose subtly prime minister able identify politics national interest manner u president regularly phill discusing power legislative house prime minister member parliament analgous although badly president please explain house representative principle powerful house lord senate practice le suggest writer constitution really intend powerful gosh darn thing wa ratify realize forget put extra restriction senate disagree system slow wa simply design handle le ha demand handle somebody washington put whose name forget congress ha become everybody city council one reason every level government render unable come decision decision push next higher level instead entry level political science course tell people want law implement always choose level government attack present best chance get want national interest group simply rational thing want federal government enact law rather state le people persuade le contribution make concern abortion primarily concentrate federal level simply win battle little state battlefield win extension extend insurance medicine question local government ha fail ha dominate local interest thus non-local interest want locality abide rule ca get rule past local government thus since get clout wrong place appeal next higher level impose lower mean let get real really need congres unite state decide x traffice light thus pattern carjack need federal oppose local crime people want congress take power sell vote think rise special interest coincidence increase power congress congress capable quick action ha enough power time hand confine original jurisidiction wa allow local autonomy start social welfare model instead current state subsidy motto would better place plenty state money hand problem distribute basis power congress basis actual need bingo higher governmental ladder le actual need matter political power concentrate higher level people le cloud find reduce effectiveness order set school project new york state pay state pork defense contract agricultural subsidy etc precise state since need beat filibuster simply leave new york education new york remain unconcinved state union capable educate child want leave worry pork state since industry ca concentrate political power wealth rather must divide among state try get want individual voice relative impact problem fillibuster must buy state congress ha acquire much power sell pork case system government create fail operate set condition specifically want avoid namely concentration power would seem proper thing reduce power either house attempt grease wheel get system move quicker stupid thing would make sense make decision local level break machine free seizure redirect earth want redirect say sell pork get thing congress congres ha le authority sell pork retain authority enact national legislation within grant jurisdiction pork problem significantly reduce current block power simply absolve congress responsibility come decision current block essentially state inaction preferable action thus system weight action consider government usually institution sole power enforce decision force consider bias make decision good thing push decision lower pyramid wo work unless lower level le corrupt case worse better difference lower pyramid legal legitimate authority matter constitution federal government b lower level power harder concentrate c get benefit impose new deicisons everybody get see try without national decision congressional action usually treat entire country whole yet even similar problem different area different solution may call often agree decision local state rep make least better option go city council shoot mouth much rather majority law make accessible people hang around end put rather somebody far washington half million constituent curious base assumption lower level corrupt fail see restriction imply otherwise place veto could easily read mean put check democratically popular unwise executive opinion policy since argue federalist paper would point phill bring federalist paper argue fillibuster whether minority senator allow hold bill claim senate wa suppose far le powerful house contend wa nothing constitution write indicate wa bring ca decide founder want base federalist paper argue never argue primarily refer constitution place small restriction senate house u constitution give almost reason work part reason give right bear arm ammendment

section veto wa mean exceptional measure follow fact senate president wa mean revise legislation would three chamber legislature two furthermore separation power would much le distinct certain extend believe veto ha become something wa intend however also believe inevitable consider congress abuse power make bill say whatever want say unlike people think worry veto fine problem congress almost necessitate abuse limit constitution president veto power regard bill previous president use veto number reason usually something agenda really curious single bush president abuse veto ha record veto bush phill absurd bush veto one wa over-ridden go read fdr think anything resemble record reasonable restriction senator magic holy number upon law must base senator feel safe enough state constituency stand fillibuster enough indicate sufficient question whether law good idea re-evaluate point fact though majority oppose minority minority allow win default inherently wrong bias system action historically governemnt action deal issue bare minority large minority successful position impose federal power diverse people federal government get something bare majority one earth sufficient enact law cover million people diverse place live radically different condition super-majority require bill issue money bill relate short term proposal switch general question fillibuster specific bill see make difference change law presupposition favour status quo arguable sure arguable argue however require bring vote ensure good argument something base solely party line system simple majority give absolute power ignore minority minority ignore see positive thing sure republican look pork much democrat get legitimate objection legislation question instead consider system minority automatically win superior completely happy system require minority action since history history carve population group implement piece-meal minority feel minority sufficent clout prevent
