spworley steve worley subject sphere point bolson edward bolson write boy embarassing trivial faq give point non coplanar doe one find sphere center radius exactly fit point know circle point immediately see straightforward way check geometry book graphic gem farin still loss please mercy provide solution bad question ref list algorithm either think bite hard take three point find plane define well circle lie say algorithm already find center circle line pass center perpendicular plane three point pass center sphere repeat unused point two original point give two different line pas sphere origin interection center sphere radius easy compute distance center original point leave math workable algorithm alternate method would take pair point plane form perpendicular bisector line segment pair also contain center sphere three pair form three plane intersect point might easier implement steve spworley
