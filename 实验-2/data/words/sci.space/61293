redesign team srt provide detail status report advisory committee redesign space station april day-long meet wa hold anser facility crystal city va topic cover srt include preliminary mission goal statement space station science technology engineer research assessment process design approach discussion management option operation concept also hold design team present three option study option modular buildup pete priest present option priest say team work define station meet cost goal ha identify three distinct phase evolution power station human tend permanent presence team define minimum capability need achieve phase total cost phase achievable capability budget level option us current simplify freedom hardware cost effective consider exist system so-called spacecraft orbiter spacelab power station capability could achieve flight freedom photo voltaic module provide kw power mission dock power station assume phase human tend capability would provide addition common module module add subsystem payload rack dock port esa japanese laboratory mission orbiter dock station assume phase different mode study phase option b freedom derive mike griffin present status option b activity griffin detail evolution freedom-derived option initial research capability human-tended capability permanent human presence capability two fault tolerance finally permanent human capability griffin also outline propose system change baseline program minor change communication track system crew health care system eclss major change data management system initial research capability would achieve flight degree inclination flight degree consist extend duration orbiter-spacelab combination dock truss segment photo voltaic array provide kw power human-tended capability would achieve flight add truss segment lab permanent human presence capability would achieve flight two orbiter provide habitation assure crew return two fault tolerance achieve flight would build section truss another set pv module thermal control propulsion system freedom derive configuration could achieve international complete state flight three flight bring habitat module third pv array two assure crew return vehicle acrv would complete permanent human capability international stage griffin tell redesign advisory committee eliminate hardware would meet budget guideline freedom derive option major reduction deferral must occur area include program management contractor non-hardware early utilization operation cost say option c singe launch core station chet vaughn present option c single launch core station concept shuttle external tank solid rocket booster would use launch station orbit shuttle main engine would mount tail station module launch jettison et separation module foot diameter foot long would provide cubic foot pressure volume separate deck connect centralize passageway seven berth port would locate various place circumference module place international module element would two fix photo voltaic array produce approximately kw power fly solar interial attitude close comment redesign advisory committee bryan say design freeze would establish option april detail cost option
