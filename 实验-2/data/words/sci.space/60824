goltz jam p goltz subject orion drive vacuum background orion spacedrive wa theoretical concept would drive use thermonuclear explosion drive spacecraft idea wa detonate device somewhere one ten megaton yield behind pusher plate attach main spacecraft shock wave explosion would transfer momentum ship atmosphere see energy explosion heat atmosphere expand explosively slam shock wave pusher plate vacuum two thing see go hit plate product barium krypton helium neutron evaporate bomb case electromagnetic radiation gamma mostly irradiate fission product would work ca see em radiation impel much momentum especially give mass pusher plate seem go get momentum transfer throw bomb back ship get detonate must miss something would someone enlighten via email thank jim jim goltz alternet engineer goltz
