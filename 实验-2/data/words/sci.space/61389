kwp kevin w plaxco subject gamma ray burster article abdkw david ward write give fact spacecraft attitude knowledge approx arcmin might able figure well batse determine location rotational gamma ray burster knowledge all-sky map accuracy pr material three instrument give accuracy order fraction degree help believe fundamental difference x three instrument focus instrument le form image positional error limit craft attitude resolve power optic batse altogether different beast effectively coincidence counter one corner craft positional information triangulate differential signal arrival time detector positional error would predominantly determine time error error craft attitude since none baste detector independant angular resolution whatsoever use determine parallax indeed parallax would add small component positional error demonstrate puppy beyond oort cloud would require resolution order arcsecond since oort cloud postulate extend parsec together parallax arc second parsec distance object demonstrate one arc second parallax au base line degree accuracy report true go add baste pluto fast flyby get enough baseline beauty baste give positional information watch entire sky simultaneously realy handy combination idea next burst come kevin
