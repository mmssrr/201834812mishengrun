ashok ashok aiyar subject set slip client window long post monthly how-to-setup slip client pc post month lot work imminent graduation come way post one march earlier month apologize file include information write script university minnesota phone also batch file hack let use packet driver phone addition modification correction reach ashok best wish ashok begin base experience set slip window comment set slip environment thank trumpet beta tester cwru slip beta tester comment configure modem turn dtr w disable dtr communication program use dial slip server qmodem drop dtr exit program therefore hang line use program like kermit conex establish slip connection need program necessarily hangup line exit note use univ minn phone dial establish slip connection need turn dtr b dial establish slip connection first automatically use program like phone university minnesota dial establish slip connection load slip packet driver phone script language simple phone script easily write configure phone work slip server addition packet driver phone work umslip currently easy write batch file hack let phone work packet driver section phone document script batch file example configure slip driver five slip packet driver commonly available peter tattam compress slip driver peter tattam slip driver crynwr driver like phil burn modify driver crynwr driver ethernet simulation slip univ minnesota driver base four vastly prefer follow reason much faster even though modem ha uart b use several others notice pc clock get mess perform long ftp transfer c support pktmux use ethernet simulation mode use ethernet simulation mode seem work every application test instruction use phone load slipper file accord instruction instance modem slipper b use application win box use double-ended packet driver shim create virtual packet driver application native mode application window box window application use virtual driver c use load next configure use interrupt instruction try get version slip driver philip burn northwestern university ha modify driver better hardware handshaking driver distribute along nupop b load driver establish slip connection modem modem would load driver w h slip c discuss use application window box probably want use use load instruction choose use instead instruction exactly one crucial difference delete line section interfere run regular window comm application crosstalk get lot drop character etc application therefore recommend etherslip would load ethersl w h configure window make follow modification file section list com port address interrupt also within window control panel double-clicking port icon ii give port modem attach generous com buffer iii change com port autoassign value com port wish use modem zero amount time window wait second hand control com port another application use want switch one session another value default value second get gpf window crash also within window control panel double-click enhance device contention set device contention com port modem never warn additional note assign different ip address slip session fortunate campus slip server assign user permanent ip address worry edit time establish slip connection assign new ip address every occasion dial please try use bootp aware software let bootp configuration however qvtnet bootp aware rarp work slip connection get qvtnet work situation must follow edit file let net section look like net name ip whatever appropriate whatever appropriate save change write-protect file attrib r start slip connection remember name ip address assign time start general configuration dialog box open enter name ip address assign session click ok run change make save write-protected elegant solution problem dynamic slip ip address assignment provide victor menayang victor victor us program bootpq semi-automate qvtnet preparation bootpq use inquire assign ip save file call myip another file noip essentially complete file lack ip address final step myip noip copy single file example victor batch file provide slipper bootpq ip myip bootpq ip copy q net myip noip e del q myip echo echo echo ready run winqvtnet question detail bootpq please contact victor menayang victor qpc software attempt add bootp capability use pktmux slip pktmux work packet driver crash immediately use pktmux work use ethernet simulation mode example configuration show latest release pktmux important use version want use virtual packet driver application like trumpet window release shortly lh ether packet driver lh pktmux pktmux load virtual packet driver lh pktdrv first virtual packet driver use lh pktdrv pktdrv use native wintrumpet additional virtual packet driver load directly within window box example pif file load popmail direct file read like pktdrv load virtual packet driver cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv u unload packet driver exit cause window close similar batch file load application like pc gopher experience pktmux work fine even virtual packet driver two independent virtual session load software interrupt example within two different box one popmail gopher virtual packet driver pktdrv load instance much doe pktmux degrade performance modem run window reasonably fast video card ati graphic ultra condition three virtual packet driver load use follow driver qvtnet ftp client session b driver one window cutcp session c driver another window trumpet get ftp transfer rate transfer compress file rate comparable get load packet driver single session active cslipper use packet driver single session active get transfer rate file degradation performance slipper benefit able use pktmux outweigh performance hit ethernet simulation mode ethernet simulation mode ver work application test one two application require ethernet simulation balk even rare problem resolve ver slipper use ethernet simulation mode use pktmux get error message qvtnet console window read ip incorrect packet type ip bad version number doe seem prevent qvtnet function although comment loss performance application doe work ethernet simulation mode rare event find package doe work ethernet simulation mode first contact author peter tattam peter let know chance fix meanwhile try follow know kosher work problem ver load describe pktmux section load run application terminate also work within window virtual box however packet driver like ethersl use one virtual box time example batch file run grateful med medical reference retrieval program develop national library medicine ethersl w h load etherslip cd search cd termin terminate etherslip exit close box return window use method cautious one thing active pktmux session open time close ethersl window run pktmux session problem btw example grateful med work problem ver
