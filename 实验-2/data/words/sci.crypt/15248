trust messenger replace every c every b alphabet someone know shift rule could decipher message cryptosystem cipher system method disguise message certain people see disguise cryptography art create use cryptosystems cryptanalysis art break cryptosystems see disguise even suppose able cryptology study cryptography cryptanalysis original message call plaintext disguise message call ciphertext encryption mean procedure convert plaintext ciphertext decryption mean procedure convert ciphertext plaintext cryptosystem usually whole collection algorithm algorithm label label call key instance caesar probably use shift n encryption several different value n natural say n key people suppose able see disguise call recipient people enemy opponent interloper eavesdropper third party reference start learn cryptology introduction technical matter survey article give part best place begin general concise author competent people well write however article mostly concern cryptology ha develop last year abstract mathematical historical codebreakers kahn encyclopedic history technical detail cryptology introductory cryptanalysis learn gain sinkov recommend especially people want devise encryption algorithm since common mistake try make system know break one selection algorithm de draw attention many public researcher problem cryptology consequently several textbook book serve text appear book denning give good introduction broad range security include encryption algorithm database security access control formal model security similar comment apply book price davy pfleeger book konheim meyer matyas quite technical book konheim meyer directly involve development de book give thorough analysis de konheim book quite mathematical detail analysis many classical cryptosystems meyer matyas concentrate modern cryptographic method especially pertain key management integration security facility computer system network book rueppel koblitz concentrate application number theory algebra cryptography doe one go cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involve interest combination analytical reason application mathematical tool pattern find patience determination luck best available textbook subject military cryptanalytics series clear proficiency cryptanalysis part gain attempt solution give system experience consider valuable cryptanalyses perform wwii ally still classify modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist factor integer take discrete logarithm traditional fare cryptanalyst computational number theorist successful cryptanalyst public key system brute-force search cryptographic relevance nutshell f x know compute f find x try every possible x brute-force search example say cryptanalyst ha find plaintext correspond ciphertext doe know key simply try encrypt plaintext use possible key ciphertext match decrypt ciphertext match plaintext whichever faster every well-designed cryptosystem ha large key space brute-force search impractical advance technology sometimes change consider practical example de ha use year ha possible key computation many operation wa certainly unlikely user situation different today give dramatic decrease cost per processor operation massively parallel machine threaten security de brute force search scenario describe garron outerbridge one phase sophisticate cryptanalysis may involve brute-force search manageably small space possibility property satisfy every strong cryptosystem security strong system reside secrecy key rather attempt keep algorithm secret strong cryptosystem ha large keyspace mention unicity distance measure give minimum amount ciphertext must intercept uniquely identify key key unicity distance much longer amount ciphertext intend encrypt key system probably strong strong cryptosystem certainly produce ciphertext appear random standard statistical test see example strong cryptosystem resist know previous attack system ha never subject scrutiny suspect system pass test mention necessarily strong certainly many weak cryptosystems look good first however sometimes possible show cryptosystem strong mathematical proof joe break system also solve well-known difficult problem factor integer see part fail crap shoot cryptosystem theoretically unbreakable guarantee analysis-proof practice cryptanalytic method include know practical cryptanalysis enemy doe stare ciphertext figure plaintext instance might assume crib stretch probable plaintext crib correct might able deduce key decipher rest message might exploit isologs plaintext encipher several cryptosystems several key thus might obtain solution even cryptanalytic theory say doe chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction misuse one-time pad example lose security use even chosen-plaintext attack enemy somehow fee plaintext encryptor deduce key employ see many people still use cryptosystems relatively easy break know better often amateur think design secure system aware expert cryptanalyst could sometimes insufficient motivation anybody invest work need crack system
