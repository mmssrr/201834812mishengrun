hanson robin hanson subject estimate wiretap would wiretap chip cost-effective robin hanson draft april summary compare average monthly phone bill sixty dollar wiretap worth two cent month police propose wiretap chip must raise phone cost le one part three thousand cost-effective background phone happen allow existence wiretap detector could pick conversation phone line time law enforcement agency come rely capability aid criminal investigation however powerful new encryption technology threaten status quo make possible truly private communication small chip phone could soon make literally impossible overhear conversation without physical microphone either end order preserve ability law enforcement agency tap phone conversation government announce april develop begin manufacture special wiretap chip place future phone instead total privacy chip private development day announce would use chip secure telephone product chip would create government supervision would give fix indentifier encryption key periodically conversation chip would broadcast identifier info special law enforcement block law enforcement officer court order could obtain key correspond indentifier special trust agency could thereby listen future previously record conversation phone date concern voice plan security government wo disclose encryption algorithm many suspect government limit access way ha claim track record previous government doe inspire confidence point however paper neglect concern ask instead whether new wiretap chip cost-effective tool police investigation cheaper way society investigate crime force phone communication support wiretap give police agency money investigate crime way put another way would police agency pay wiretap pay share full social cost force phone support wiretap start answer question might compare current benefit wiretap provide law enforcement agency project cost implement new wiretap chip plan since current benefit easier estimate begin wiretap benefit latest year wiretap statistic available year wiretap installation request request deny figure doe include wiretap obtain consent party conversation arrest result wiretap start year arrest come wiretap previous year arrest lead conviction wiretap phone v pager email etc regard drug offense request federal authority wiretap installation hear average call incriminate among people cost average extrapolate installation report cost mostly labor thus total million wa spend wiretap obtain arrest per arrest thus arrest least four time expensive per arrest figure one get divide billion spend police nationally total million non-traffic arrest thus million per year spend phone tap one thousanth total police expenditure divide million phone access line country get cent spend per year per phone line two cent month general deter give class criminal combination perceive probability catch convict expect punishment level convict social value wiretap amount would pay get criminal deterrence mean unable wiretap particular suspect phone police might instead use hide microphone investigate suspect way police might focus suspect easily investigate without wiretap might raise fine prison time certain type crime generously assume substitute wiretap would average twice expensive wiretap annual social benefit phone wiretap equal current spend level two cent month per phone line wiretap cost let u moment optimistically assume u government encryption scheme secure whatever private enterprise would offer instead protect conversation spy ear neighbor corporation government foreign domestic even need support wiretap would add many additional cost build maintain communication system extra law enforcement block would add phone transmission increase traffic unknown percentage special process must use add encryption key chip securely distribute key special agency must fund monitor chip design military contractor whose design remain secret manufacture special process chip become nearly impossible take apart chip offer relatively high price peice lot private encryption system support wiretap would require none extra cost perhaps important government degree would least partially replace private marketplace evolution standard voice represent encrypt exchange future phone widely believe government le efficient private enterprise procure product standard though may perhaps perform useful broker role choose compete private standard much le efficient matter debate say pay twice much others might say currently total billion spend operate expense phone company come per month per access line compare wiretap value two cent per month see wiretap raise average operate cost even much one part wiretap cost effective doe even include extra cost phone owner pay encryption chip expensive course phone would encryption chip wiretap benefit per phone still argument still apply conclusion give dramatic difference total cost run phone system value wiretap justify slightest modification phone system accommodate wiretap modification require wa allow investigator attach clip phone wire wiretap support may reasonable consider substantial modification burden proof clearly propose modification show cost would really le benefit consensus obtain estimate compromise might tax phone support wiretap rate say five cent per month tax payable
