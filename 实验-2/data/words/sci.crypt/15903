reprogramming change chip around criminal motivate find intact phone associate someone else non-stupid criminal conclude clipper-secure communication least limit time buy beg borrow steal use someone phone way prevent person report compromise phone least time encrypt communication might record thus retrievable later criminal delay quite likely evade discovery destroy abandon phone elapse would unusual innocent person volunteer use clipper phone someone else honest subscriber doe want pay someone else bill doe want fall suspicion leaf two source clipper phone criminal use coercion collusion coercion first theft bear relatively low risk also sometimes low time detection minute phone steal car park front store couple week phone steal someone away vacation criminal commerce likely arise steal clipper phone phone come risk-inured poor criminal cash come risk-averse wealthy criminal someone extraordinarily motivate gain day two undetected communication like terrorist could kill person hold hostage limit time detection coerce phone useful mean continue criminal enterprise require continue supply freshly coerce phone would also create collusive commerce relatively wealthy criminal ignorant patsy need money submit pay return subscribe clipper phone service someone else use criminal learn advantage coerce use clipper cellphone apply non-clipper cipher normal cellphone call much

automate full-system surveillance mechanism quite feasible across radio bandwidth know family key f validate clipper wrapper n esn association reveal realtime use super-encryption unless know unit key assure make available two separate piece upon specific wiretap-like order whereas criminal use cipher within normally cleartext medium would stand criminal use non-clipper cipher within clipper medium would difficult detect even ex post facto bulk record long association criminal specific clipper chip fracture make use cipher illegal per se charge criminal identify true criminal use someone else phone evidence help whatever traditional crime might plan even able detect unusual encrypt communication occur identify specific phone obtain key escrow gangster terrorist thus arguably le secure clipper come along therefore consider clipper harmful doe provide absolute privacy honest public aggressive dishonest government cipher proscribe engender new type direct criminal threat honest public provide extraordinarily effective mechanism criminal hide use cipher make difficult ever even gain notice unusual communication occur plan criminal act might progress cipher proscribe lazy
