stable become utilize widely without early problem interoperability fingerprint like message digest algorithm produce rsa data security inc provide fingerprint cryptographically secure hash plaintext cryptographically secure possible reasonable amount computation produce different plaintext produce fingerprint thus instead sign entire message sender private key message need sign authentication also exchange directly authentication example ripem public key include public key file party wish confirm key authentic via separate channel merely need exchange key verify accuracy sometimes use
