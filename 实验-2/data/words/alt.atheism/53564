baysian statistician type statistician would helpful statistician either idea theism atheism compatible read observation date however theism type concern also suggest instance prayer may answer people may miraculously heal principle amenable statistical verification may generally intervene measurable way mean region space possible observation loosely term appearance nonzero probability theistic hypothesis zero atheistic since much probability available hypothesis scatter around observation space probability theism expend make appearance possible must come somewhere else possible observation else equal mean observation appearance must slightly higher probability atheism theism bayesian stuff imply observation must cause run estimate probability atheistic hypothesis increase correspond

probability exist important draw distinction theism could support support evidence theism ca give theism evidence principle possible doe make sense say lack evidence support contrary view quite type theism might call g hg term ockham razor discussion bin grind depend upon conception god conception like zeus happen come earth play quite frequently agree lack evidence conception god evidence doe exist conception god one doe make falsifiable prediction see falsifiable prediction disagree lack evidence doe support disbelief hypothesis falsifiable indeed model theism falsifiable use phrase obverse give specific theism doe make prediction p x ht use word theism make prediction specific event say believe god happen believe god give never priori say p x ht even say set like use probability

observation must choose care curious know type observation x x mind concern theism atheism observation like really doe matter affect reason provide possible observation would count appearance example might demonstration efficacy prayer veracity revelation statement p x h general x still count prediction h theism question ht say prayer may answer miracle may happen see interpretation quote god exist mean prediction p x ht x distinguish atheist hypothesis ha predict stuff doe happen p x ha x theism doe make claim p x ht x say theism doe maybe wa quick say common language say existence god mean notion deity describe bible christian doe interact universe claim agent agree however must careful believe make claim maybe change doe important shift emphasis way since belief conclude p x ht x ok downgrade doe interact may interact would actually better since doe interact imply falsifiability agree misplace think theism make prediction maybe understand mean prediction could explain mean word explain bear mind central require theism make prediction appearance never happen doe atheism somebody point quantum mechanic doe make prediction either difference qm atheism form partition prediction include statement prayer efficacious imply stats find prayer efficacious prayer efficacious verily say unto generation shall pas till thing fulfil think problem misunderstand persistent observation stuff happen consistent ht though may consistent ha explain bayesian stats post even ht god exist unfalsifiable problem argument let number observation go infinity falsify asymptotically btw consider argument require infinite number observation valid rather part argument valid exist human never make infinite number measurments conclusion reilies accept valid fine claim theism false merely finite number observation available far suggest continue observe suggestion look better better renormalization stuff delete bayesian stats post assume theism wa indeed unfalsifiable finite number observation relevant quote important assumption observation compatible theist hypothesis atheist hypothesis thus would falsify atheism call appearance need take literally observation require explanation one god exist count observation assume compatible hypothesis leaf theism unfalsifiable atheism falsifiable single observation appearance problem something falsifiable must make prediction see see hypothesis ha falsify atheism word oposition something theism theism aserts belief atheism aserts disbelief certain atheism certainly falsifiable certain theism falsifable theism assert world year old god doe decieve ha falsify however atheism oposition unfalsifiable theism also unfalsifiable could wrong statment contd think appearance sufficient falsify atheism whereas general correspond theism unfalsifiable think general question suppse x unfalsifiable x also unfalsifiable way counterexample let x coin fair accurately x make sense two side coin different unfalsifiable toss coin even string head consistent fair coin go infinite number toss falsify x limit converse falsifiable falsify least one head least one tail appear partly wrong baysian argument require observation x x n make simply observation truth value relation statement god exist use symmetry argument understand someone would say since statement doe exist make prediction choose believe none le would found type faith like word faith insert belief falsifiable evidence instead assume mean god exist highlight agree definition exist statement make prediction say although falsifiable finite number observation actually mean doe exist make prediction oops sorry mea culpa truth statment actually depend upon god refer think conception god true open posibility could wrong give example prediction statment god doe exist one think true would heal miricles principle never determine one way case people seem recover heal without help doctor know reason situation fact happen consistent theistic hypothesis way support hypothesis agree inconsistent atheistic hypothesis ca think one prediction doe exist type might miss something rapture happen october say rapture would falsify atheism satisfaction happen although failure happen doe course falsify theism specifically predict phenomenon require existence one god explanation ever observe sum whole thing bob singleton bob cheer simon simon clippingdale simon
